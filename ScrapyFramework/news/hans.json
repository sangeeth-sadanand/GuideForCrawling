He said that it is unbecoming for a Union minister to speak lies. He demanded the Centre to immediately take steps to establish the factory.\nVeerabhadram said it is clearly mentioned: \"under Clause 13 of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act that the Centre would establish a steel factory in Khammam district with an outlay of Rs 30,000 crore.\" The Centre is buying time and dragging the issue in the name of conducting surveys even after eight years. He said Reddy's statements that iron ore available in Bayyaram lacks quality are nothing more than preventing development of Telangana, he added. \n\"It does not suit well for a Union minister to speak lies about quality of iron ore of Bayyaram. \nThe CPM leader asked why about 20 private companies have applied for permission from the government if ore available there is not of suitable quality. Also, how earlier several companies mined the ore and profited from its exports. Veerabhadram said one company had mined the ore till 2010; exported lakhs of tonnes. How it all happened if ore is of unsuitable quality, he questioned. \n The BJP-led Centre failed to fulfil the assurances under the Reorganisation Act and dashed the hopes of tribal people, who have been waiting for so long that the industry would provide employment opportunities and cause development in their area, he said. \nThe CPM leader said that Bayyaram has basic amenities.

This had been a 'brainwave' of BJP leader Yashpal Suvarna a strong Mogaveera leader in the North of Dakshina Kannada district.\nIt could be recalled that the tall leader of the Congress party in Dakshina Kannada B Janardhana Poojary had initiated Mangaluru Dasara as early as 1991 centred around the Kudroli Gokarnanatha Temple in Mangaluru which has made it the second best Dasara festivities organised in the state only after the fabled Mysuru Dasara that began over 422 years back in Vijayanagar empire and now is the signature event of the entire Karnataka. Both versions of Dasara have their own variations. While Mysuru Dasara has the patronage of the government and the halo of Royal touch of the erstwhile Wadiyar Royal family, the Mangaluru Dasara is known as 'Common man's Dasara' (refer Hans India report dated 26 September 2022). \nJust last week the BJP announced that they will organise a 'Pili Parba'on the lines of 'Pili Nalike' organised by young INC leader and KPCC general secretary Mithun Rai. Now Yashpal Suvarna a tall Mogaveera leader does a redux of Janardhana Poojary to make Uchila Mahalakshmi temple centre of 'Uchila Dasara'for ten days. Preparations are already on for the event. \"It will be recorded as the best local Dasara festivity on the coast, and how can it be attributed to political motives I am not able to gauge\" Yashpal Suvarna said. \nThe Mahalakshmi temple is a centre of faith for the fisherfolk (Mogaveeras) not just for the Udupi and Dakshina Kannada but also 'Kuladevata'of Mogaveeras and other marine fisherfolk sub-castes all across the coast. It has a devotee lineup of 7 lakh people. \nThe Mahalakshmi temple at Uchila is next only to the one in Kolhapur Suvarna informed. Already 50,000 and more people are visiting every day and to my estimation, the attendance might cross 10 lakh people on Vijayadashami day. On that day we have a 27 kilometer long procession participated by over 110 tableaux 30 different folk dancer troupes coming from all over Karnataka, Suvarna said. \nThe Congress party does not grudge it, though it is aware of the intense movement of the BJP to usurp its support base by using temples and traditional socio-religious practices. Mogaveera leaders at the hustings in a hush-hush tone say the Gokarnatha temple is fully in the grip of the BJP and days are not far when Mahalakshmi temple of Uchila will polarise various Hindu groups particularly Mogaveeras they claim.

The fleet comprising four helicopters was inducted into the IAF at a ceremony at the Jodhpur Air Force Station in presence of Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari and other senior military officials. \nThe defence minister named the helicopter as 'Prachand' (fierce) and said the platform, capable of operating in day and night, will add significant edge to the IAF's combat capabilities as it can hit enemy targets with precision. \nSingh, who also flew a sortie on the LCH, said it can operate in all possible conditions, and is among one of the best globally in its class. The helicopter, with its wide range of missiles and other weapons, can hit enemy infantry, tanks, bunkers, drones and other assets in high-altitude regions, military officials said. In his address, Singh described induction of the indigenously-built LCH into the IAF as a \"momentous occasion\" for India's defence production. \"The IAF has been playing an important role in protecting India's sovereignty and I am confident that its overall capability will enhance further following induction of LCH,\" Singh said in his address. \"We have been focusing on boosting the country's defence production following certain developments.... security of the country has been our foremost priority and it will remain so,\" he said.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/news/national/home-built-light-chopper-inducted-764109"},

{"title": "Scope and potentiality of naturopathy", "date": "21 Sep 2022 6:43 PM GMT ", "description": "A few sincere but misguided enthusiasts are attempting the impossible and bringing ridicule upon themselves, ignorant of the higher possibilities, missing their opportunities and bringing discredit upon themselves and their art. Accuracy and efficiency in naturopathy therapeutics is only possible to those who have a clearly defined idea of the field.\nIt is imperative that healthcare providers have an understanding of the training and scope of other health professionals in order to effectively make decisions regarding research, collaborative clinical care, and policy. Given the prevalence of use of complementary and alternative medicine by people and families in India, and the growing interest in 'integrative' medicine, we aim to offer an overview of naturopathic care for people. This article describes the principles, training, and scope of naturopathic medicine, including health promotion, disease prevention, and illness management. It describes the process by which naturopathic doctors (NDs) create an integrative healthcare plan for people, evaluate and apply evidence, and integrate ethical issues in practice management. \nMedical pluralism is an important part of the history of the naturopathic profession. The roots of modern naturopathic training and practice lie in the integration of diverse approaches to health from a variety of doctrines. Some practitioners lean toward more traditional approaches (such as acupuncture or traditional herbal medicine), while others favor methods that have well-understood biomedical mechanisms and a rigorous evidence base. Many work with a combination of the two. Some NDs emphasise lifestyle strategies, while others rely more on the use of natural health products and other approaches. \nThe principles of naturopathic medicine act as a touchstone for NDs. As with all healthcare providers, NDs are guided by the fundamental principle of no maleficence; five additional principles inform naturopathic care and decision-making, all of which are emphasized throughout training. The Therapeutic Order was designed as a framework for holistic care to which these principles are applied. While a critical part of an ND's role is identifying when more forceful methods and/or referral may be necessary, the principles of the profession remind clinicians to approach families and people holistically, individually, and with the least force possible in order to achieve the therapeutic goal. \n \nNDs act in general care in both primary and consultative roles. They are trained to promote and monitor healthy growth and development, educate families on preventative strategies, address risk factors for disease, and manage childhood illnesses. As all primary care providers do, NDs may play a number of roles in the care of people: Wellness promotion; Prevention of disease; Surveillance and screening for developmental delay or disease; Management of acute and chronic illness; Coordination of care; Advocacy for a healthy community and environment; and, Wellness Promotion and Prevention of Disease \nWorking with people and families is the epitome of prevention and health promotion. When a healthy childhood is fostered, there is tremendous potential for lifelong individual and community health. Achieving these purposes requires an appreciation of the determinants of health, and normal growth and development. Progress in hygiene, nutrition, and medical innovation in the past century has shifted the focus of North American pediatric practice from managing infection and malnutrition to preventing chronic conditions that have roots in early life. There is a plethora of evidence highlighting the importance of fostering good lifestyle practices, such as optimal diet, physical movement, sufficient sleep, minimal exposure to environmental toxins, and stress mitigation, and the social and ecological determinants influencing these. Practice models generally ensure that encounter time is adequate to engage with families regarding the determinants of health most relevant to the child, their family, and their broader community, and to offer strategies to promote wellness in both the short and long term. \nNaturopathic doctors are taught to draw on conventional standards of care and algorithms to guide diagnostic reasoning and management options, while factoring in frameworks from other medical paradigms (for example, consideration of a Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnosis). Depending on the nature of the illness, the values of the family, and the experience and scope of the clinician, a variety of therapeutic options may be considered. This may include the use of botanical medicines (either topical or oral), other natural health products such as nutritional supplements or probiotics, or hydrotherapy (the therapeutic application of hot and cold water to manipulate circulation). NDs with the training and authority to do so may prescribe or administer pharmaceutical medications; or perform acupuncture, acupressure, or manual therapies (such as soft tissue or joint manipulation). \nThose without such authority are trained to appropriately refer to other providers when indicated. Management plans typically include recommendations for optimizing lifestyle factors such as diet, sleep habits, physical activity, stress mitigation and spending time in nature.

{"title": "At 75, India Still Needs A Gandhi", "date": "1 Oct 2022 10:25 PM GMT ", "description": "A question that often crops up at debates is \"Whether Gandhiji is relevant today? Do we really need a Gandhi in India? The pessimists among us may say an emphatic 'No,' while the optimists may feel that these questions are asinine as the Mahatma has a perpetual and perennial relevance not only in India but in the entire world. They say that we need him now more than ever. \nAfter having watched the film, 'Gandhi' by Richard Attenborough, a gentleman said that, \"It was a film that moved me to accepting the power and wisdom of the man.\" To know something about his power and wisdom, one has to look at Gandhi the lawyer, Gandhi the leader, and Gandhi the man. In other words, what does Gandhi really mean to us? \nAs a lawyer in South Africa, Gandhi displayed his power of being morally right. In his 21 long years of law practice, Gandhi never swerved from the path of truth. He firmly believed that \"Facts means truth and once we adhere to truth, the law comes to our aid naturally.\" It was his power of truth as he fondly thought that \"Truth alone triumphs\", which he made his life principle. Today we are desperately in need of his power of truth because, as John Keats said that \"Beauty is truth, truth, beauty/and that is all/ ye know on earth/ all ye need to know.\" Keeping this in mind, our PM Modi in the UNO last time talking on the occasion of 'Gandhi @150', emphatically spoke about the relevance of Gandhi's message of truth, non-violence for us today. \nGandhi lived half naked not without reason but as a true leader of his poor and impoverished people. This had won for him the pejorative term, \"Half-naked Fakhir\" from none other than an arrogant Winston Churchill! \nFinally, Gandhi the man had faced many ups and downs in life. As a husband of a devout and dutiful wife, as a father of four children, Gandhi weathered many challenges. In his youth, Gandhi encountered many temptations like Jesus. But Jesus resisted them while Gandhi yielded to them only to conquer them as Oscar Wild believed that \"The only way to overcome a temptation is to yield to it.\" A truly spiritual person loves all people, prays for them, crosses all hurdles of hate and envy, leads an austere and contented life. Gandhi, the man, did all these things. He helped the poor, worked for the sick, and gave new lease of life to lepers by taking them into his care! Such wisdom about God and life, we need now more than ever. \n \nThough every leader swears allegiance to follow the doctrine of Ahimsa or non-violence set by Mahatma Gandhi and hailing him as the gentle prophet of the world promising to secure a life of dignity and peace to every human being, in reality what is witnessed is that the present stock of leaders have been only doing the opposite to grab power by hook or crook. As a result, the political scenario is only worsening. \nWhat is more shocking is that on two days of a year i.e., on 30th January and 2nd October, every leader without fail invokes religiously Gandhiji's words \"My Religion is Hinduism - - - -which, for me, is religion of humanity and truth through which I am being led to the path of non-violence and compassion\" to identify themselves as the true and strict follower of ideals of the Mahatma. But the reality is quite bitter. \nWhile it was remarkable that without the aid of modern communication methods, Gandhiji could awaken the hearts and minds of the country's millions who were ready to follow him in true spirit even though he did not promise them power or riches, it is sad that none is ready to accept today's leaders as their actions in every issue belies truth and sincerity. At a time of moral decadence where terrorism, radicalisation, extremism and mindless hate are dividing societies and nations, let us all on the birth anniversary of our beloved Bapu recollecting the clarion calls of peace and ahimsa of Gandhiji not only celebrate the thoughts of Mahatma but also imbibe it fully every day to unite humanity because after all 'Gandhism is a synonym of humanism'. \n \nOctober 2, 2022 is the 154th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi whose life was inspired by the world renowned Indian treatise of Bhagavad Gita. His life was led by moral strength he acquired from Hindu Dharma in which he believed immensely. Gandhi had a clear vision of classical culture and traditions adopted by the people of India. He had cultivated the path of non-violence by taking a cue from India's policy of non-aggression which also included the teachings of Gautama Buddha. \nThe attitude of integrating people of all hues was adopted by Gandhi to unify the nation during the freedom struggle. The Gandhian path of peace and non-violence was adopted by world leaders like Martin Luther King (Jr.) during revolt raised in the US against racism. Nelson Mandela was led to success on the issue of human rights and racial discrimination in South Africa only through the idealistic approach shown by Gandhi. Several leaders of world nations declared that they wholeheartedly accepted and followed the Gandhian ideology of peace and non-violence. \nThe ill-will and conspiracies among the Britishers were responsible for not considering Mahatma for the Nobel peace prize. The Nobel Prize selection committee had to hang its head in shame for such a folly. \nGandhi was an expert in making social reforms a part of political struggle. He resented religious conversions, invited women to participate in the freedom struggle, employed hunger strikes in protest against the policies devised by the British rulers, and taught the policy of evenly following the righteous norms in achieving final targets/goals. All in all, the present-day leaders and all the new generation of representatives should study the life and teachings of Gandhi and scrupulously follow the relevance of his ideology.

{"title": "Divyotsavam... Brahmotsavam", "date": "24 Sep 2022 7:42 PM GMT ", "description": "All is set for the celestial fete of Brahmotsavam at Tirumala, the only festival in the country that is celebrated with unparalleled grandeur wherein the presiding deity along with his consorts Sridevi and Bhudevi are taken around in different Vahanas (Rathams) to the accompaniment of bhajans and fanfare around the streets surrounding the temple.\nThe fete will begin with Ankurarpanam on September 28 and would conclude on October 5 with Chakra Snanam. It is believed that during these nine days, Gods descend to participate in the daily festivities. Apart from special pujas, daily Annadanam is also provided during the festival. \nBrahmotsavam was initiated in the year 986. It is said that Pallava queen Samsvaya donated lands to the Srivari temple for conduct of Brahmotsavam. Initially they were celebrated 12 times a year but over ages it has become an annual event. \nThe Sri Vaishnava shrine is popular as Kaliyuga Vaikuntam. The Pallava, the Chola and the Vijayanagar kings strived for development of Srivari shrine. History shows that the Mysore Maharaja and Gadwal Samsthan chiefs visited Tirumala and promoted activities and Utsavams at Srivari temple. Later, 11th century onwards, Sri Ramanujacharya who visited Srivari shrine several times took initiative to frame temple traditions, regulations for puja etc., as per Agama Shastra. \nThe twin Brahmotsavams are observed once in three years and during the Salakatla Brahmotsavam this year priority is given to common devotees for Darshan, Prasadam and Anna Danam. During the last two years due to Corona, festivities and Utsavas were held in ekantha without devotees.This year Brahmotsavam festivities will be held with original grandeur. \nSince we anticipate footfalls in lakhs, elaborate arrangements are made for stay, Darshan and Anna Dana. \nAs the space for accommodation is limited, TTD is arranging special sheds and mobile bathrooms. For devotees benefit, Anna Dana will be held at several locations. Keeping common devotees in view all privileged darshans, VIP break, senior citizens divyanga, donors privileges, Rs 300 special Darshan, Srivani trust donors privilege Darshan etc., all have been cancelled. Henceforth, Sarva Darshan is open for 365 days and 24x7 basis. No recommendation letters would be accepted during all the nine days of Brahmotsavam. \nTTD is making extensive arrangements for devotees to watch the grand regalia of Sri Malayappa on Mada streets on all the nine days. Beginning with Ankurarpanam and Dwajarohanam, colourful festivities will enthral devotees. The Dwajarohanam is an event, wherein legendary Garuda, the chariot of Vishnu, atop the Dwaja not only invites Gods from three Lokas, but also oversees all festivities and guards against setbacks etc. On the evening of Dwajarohanam, Sri Malayappa Swami along with consorts Sri Devi and Bhudevi will go round the Mada streets where two lakh devotees can sit in galleries and witness the gala event. On the second day, Swami will ride Chinna Sesha Vahana and Hamsa Vahana. \nOn day three, Simha Vahana and Muthyapu Pandiri Vahana Seva will be offered. On fourth day, Kalpavruksha and Sarva Bhupala Vahana will take place and on the fifth day morning the God will be seen in Mohini Alankaram and Garuda Vahana. \nOn the sixth day, Hanumanta Vahana and Gaja Vahana, Surya Prabha and Chandra Prabha Vahana processions would be taken out. \nDay seven will see Rathotsavam and Aswa Vahana will mark day eight. The event would conclude on ninth day morning with holy Chakra Snanam and Dwajavarohanam in the evening. \nColourful electrical and floral decorations and welcome arches are being erected. The TTD Board is committed to making Brahmotsavam as a household event for devotees. As per tradition, AP Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy will present Pattu Vastram to the Lord on September 27. All festivities, pujas, Vahana Sevas, devotee-friendly programmes will be live telecast by SVBC channel. \nAs Tirupati laddus are unique and devotees pilgrimage does not conclude without Srivari laddus, TTD has kept a huge stock of laddus for the Brahmotsavam. The TTD is geared up to manufacture five lakh laddus daily. \nSimilarly, arrangements are also made for tonsuring at least 60,000 devotees during Brahmotsavam with additional barbers. \n TTD is arranging special sheds, mobile bathrooms \n\u2666 Anna Dana will be held at several locations \n\u2666 All privileged darshans, VIP break, senior citizens divyanga, donors privileges, Rs 300 special Darshan, Srivani trust donors privilege Darshan etc., all have been cancelled \n\u2666 Henceforth, Sarva Darshan is open for 365 days and 24x7 basis. \n\u2666 No recommendation letters would be accepted during all the nine days of Brahmotsavam \n\u2666 TTD has kept a huge stock of laddus for the Brahmotsavam.

{"title": "A means to achieve $10 trn economy", "date": "22 Sep 2022 10:00 PM GMT ", "description": "The development and expansion of Indian enterprises, especially in terms of improving capital use efficiency, can benefit from understanding global trends in money management and business efficiency.\nThe one trend that has been in focus throughout the asset management industry, especially the private equity world, is \"permanent capital.\" This is broadly defined as access to funds for long periods instead of the usual seven to ten-year fund horizon that has been the norm in the private equity industry. Permanent capital funds focus less on exiting investments in a defined period \u2013 and the emphasis is more on generating potential long-run investment returns. \nInvestors have generated permanent capital through a variety of strategies. Some large investors, such as Blackstone, Apollo & KKR, have utilised Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) to generate capital they can invest strategically. Apollo has also generated permanent capital through investing, and managing assets for a retirement solution focused annuity business called \"Athene,\" which, through its annuity business, generates significant cash that Apollo has utilised to generate returns. \nPermanent Capital Vehicles' (PCVs) growing popularity, in large part, was inspired by Warren Buffett. As the head of one PE firm was quoted by Financial Times, \"everyone is suffering from Warren Buffett envy.\" Specifically, Berkshire Hathaway's buy-and-hold investment strategy, wherein every investment is viewed as an acquisition in a company rather than a mere trade. As such, the investment is considered a vote of confidence in the company's prospects and a long-term commitment to helping it achieve the same. As Buffett himself once famously noted, his \"favourite holding period is forever.\" \nWhile Berkshire Hathaway may be the most celebrated name in the PCV space, it is by no means the only one. Markel Corporation, Danaher, Apollo, ThermoFisher, KKR and Johnson & Johnson are other examples - and the list is growing. \nSo how will Permanent Capital help India in the next decade? \nThe success of nations/economies depends on access to high-quality growth and low-cost capital. While India will enjoy high growth due to favourable demographic and economic factors, access to the low cost of capital will be critical. As the world heads toward high inflation and high-interest rates, the ability to make India an attractive destination for global capital is a must. The Indian government has been making a huge push in this direction. Government-led economic planning platforms, such as the development of GIFT City and the International Financial Service Centre (IFSC) in Gujarat, have already been created. There is a significant push to create a more open and conducive regulatory scheme and simpler tax structure. With Permanent Capital, India will have the advantage of accessing global investments while generating long-term returns for investors. \nS Permanent capital allows prioritising value and steady long-term returns over risky one-time buyouts that may be adversely impacted by unpredictable market cycles. Long-term value creation will help generate significant returns. \nS\tWith higher degree of permanent capital, it will allow Indian businesses and investors to access opportunities for longer periods, ride out periods of high market volatility and, most importantly, acquire assets at attractive valuations when rivals cannot do so due to unfavourable market conditions or internal distress. \nS\tWith permanent capital, Indian companies can pursue essential high-growth-high-return projects that may yield significant investment returns in the future. \nS For investors looking toward emerging markets such as India, PCVs are essential, especially in the context of relatively lesser secondary market liquidity, longer investment horizons for value generation and smaller size of debt capital markets. Using PCVs to hold on to investments longer for value creation could be a vital factor. \nS Most importantly, stable cash flows via permanent capital can help shield India from adverse market conditions and businesses from the adverse funding conditions and assist a company in acquiring valuable assets across the industry. Over the past decade, long-term investing has garnered more takers, especially in the aftermath of the Great Recession, following which economic growth, especially in developed countries, was muted. The usual buy-and-sell-quickly strategy was becoming less viable. Case in point: a quarter of buyout firms worldwide never raised a fund post-2008. \nAs the capital markets and businesses in India evolve, winners and losers in highly competitive markets will be determined by various factors, including sources of funds. Both the quality and quantity of funding available will be one of the fundamental factors determining long-term winners. Permanency of capital offers some essential insights into improving one's competitiveness. \n(The views are personal and that of the authors who head AltG, a firm that offers proprietary investment research) ", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/opinion/news-analysis/a-means-to-achieve-10-trn-economy-762783"},
{"title": "It's time for resurgence of secular, democratic forces", "date": "1 Oct 2022 10:35 PM GMT ", "description": "According to media reports, Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao is busy drawing his strategy of launching a national party shortly. Some papers have also indicated date and time. Whether the announcement comes now or little later, KCR has, time and again, been very critical of divisive politics and politics of concentration of power in the Center as pursued by the BJP government. Underscoring that secular and democratic thinking intellectuals are feeling very bad for this, KCR makes it clear that only people are supreme in a democracy like India. \nKCR reminds how various democratic and Left forces came together under the leadership of Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan (JP) to trounce the dictator ruler of the day and came to power in just 40-50 days, stressing the need for a similar movement. Arrogance on the part of BJP will no more be tolerated, he warns, citing the downfalls of dictators such as Hitler, Mussolini and Napoleon. He also predicts that BJP will be ousted from power within next 18 months. The inference is another JP in the form of KCR is in the offing with his alternative agenda. \nWhen the very existence of democracy, secularism, pluralistic society, socialist pattern, peace and harmony of this great country are at stake, people often ask what would happen next. For all those prophets of doom and pessimists, there is nothing to get worried or agitated about. The beauty of Indian democracy, the largest in the world and perhaps one and only country that won freedom from colonial rule and sustained democracy, lies in its course correction. Like the proverbial Phoenix, India as a democratic entity has the ability with right leadership to correct itself and move forward with no regrets. This is exactly where people are looking to KCR and for the right time for launching his national party. \nIn Post-Independence Indian politics and governance, people by and large got accustomed to a level of tolerance. When the limits are exceeded by the party or leader at the helm of affairs, be it in the form of exhibiting dictatorial tendencies or moving towards extreme left or right, or signs of instability, alternative leadership automatically emerged. When Indira Gandhi got rid of syndicate, the earliest seeds of right-wing domination in her own party; when she herself turned dictatorial, and was trounced by a combination of left-right combination led by Jayaprakash Narayan; when unstable Janata government was defeated by Indira; when NT Rama Rao-powered National Front defeated Rajiv Gandhi who got involved in corruption charges like Bofors and VP Singh becoming Prime Minister; this was proved beyond doubt. The repetition of either Congress-led UPA or BJP-led NDA forming governments alternately at the Center needs to be done away with. \nPandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister who commanded the respect of persons of diverse ideologies \u2013 left, right and moderate \u2013 was undeniably an ardent secular in appeal but conscientiously followed his religious beliefs. He never exhibited fanatism. Nehru believed in socialistic pattern of society and thus was at equi-distance from the capitalist and the communist ideologies and followed the tolerant midway ideologue. That was how the journey of parliamentary democracy with secular and socialistic spirit commenced in India 75 years ago. Lal bahadur Shastri succeeded Nehru and was in office for just 19 months. With the slogan of 'Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan', he broke Pakistan's arrogance forever in the 1965 war. \nIndira Gandhi succeeded Shastri amidst expectations of Syndicate wing of Congress party, who were bye and large followers of right-wing ideology, that they can control her remotely. Initially, she too played their game. Her support to VV Giri, against the official Congress party candidate Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, in the Presidential Election in 1969, was the major turning point in Indian politics. The divisive forces were fought successfully for the first time by Indira Gandhi. Her progressive decisions such as bank nationalization led to her expulsion and split in the party. \nPresident Giri dissolved Lok Sabha and elections were held in March 1971 and Indira Gandhi won against the Grand Alliance represented by anti-progressive, anti-democratic and divisive forces, a pre-poll alliance with SSP, PSP, the Swatantra Party and Bharatiya Jana Sangh. Following Allahabad High Court historical judgment and Supreme Court's partial stay, Indira Gandhi riding high over her popularity imposed emergency and got arrested many opposition leaders. To fight the dictatorial arrogance of Indira Gandhi, people rose to the occasion and leadership came in the form of Jayaprakash Narayan (JP). Indira lost power in the elections held two years after imposition of emergency. Extreme rightwing Jana Sangh to the extreme left parties came under one umbrella. Morarji Desai became the Prime Minister. \nJanata coalition headed by Morarji Desai, which included right wing Hindu Nationalists with loyalties to RSS, was united mainly by its hatred of Indira Gandhi rather than fighting dictatorial tendencies. The government lost majority due to infighting and Charan Singh replaced him. In the subsequent elections, Indira Gandhi swept back into power with the slogan of 'vote for stability.' People preferred Indira to right-wing Hindu nationalists and unstable governments. \nRajiv Gandhi succeeded Indira and in the elections that followed he won the largest majority in history. After five years, he was defeated by National Front, an opposition coalition headed by NT Rama Rao. VP Singh who uncovered political corruption of Rajiv became the Prime Minister. BJP and left parties extended outside support but BJP withdrew after a few months over the Ram temple issue causing its collapse. Chandrashekhar succeeded VP Singh. \nAfter Rajiv Gandhi's assassination amidst election campaign, in May 1991, PV Narasimha Rao succeeded Chandrashekhar as the Prime Minister after the general elections in June. Rao began efforts to restructure India's economy from day one. His years as Prime Minister saw the emergence of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as an alternative to Congress. \nAtal Bihari Vajpayee of BJP became the Prime Minister of India thrice. Between Vajpayee's first and second terms, there were two unstable United Front governments headed by HD Devegowda and IK Gujral for less than two years put together. Vajpayee was the first Indian Prime Minister not of the Indian National Congress to serve a full term in office. \nIn 2004 elections Congress led by Sonia Gandhi emerged as the single largest party and formed the United Progressive Alliance. The UPA, with the outside support of Communist Parties, formed the next government headed by Manmohan Singh. The 2009 general election saw the UPA return with an increased mandate, with Singh continuing as the Prime Minister. \nIn the 2014 elections, Narendra Modi led the BJP to victory and won a majority of seats on its own and became Prime Minister. Second time he became the Prime Minister following his party's and NDA's grand victory in 2019 elections. However, as the years passed, Modi is being criticised for centralising power and belittling cooperative federalism and thereby systematically eroding federal structure. He controversially initiated demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes and farm laws. Modi remains a figure of controversy for his Hindu nationalist beliefs, democratic relapsing, bulldozing every institution, undermining basic rights of democracy and weakening secular fabric of the nation, besides ruthlessly, arrogantly and unethically trying to silence the opposition, immorally and illegally toppling the democratically elected state governments. \nKCR's proposed national party seems to be fully gearing up to shoulder the responsibility and take lead to enlist the support of non-Congress, non-BJP parties for 'BJP-Mukt Bharat' to protect the country from the harmful divisive forces and to restore the country back to its glorious past of secularist traditions and commitment to diversity. It also will be the beginning to lay a strong foundation for the country to once again stand tall with true democratic and secular values and become an economic power in Asia as well as in the world.

{"title": "The futile exercise of renaming", "date": "21 Sep 2022 6:38 PM GMT ", "description": "\"What's in a name? That which we call a rose/by any other name would smell as sweet.\" That is Juliet telling Romeo that a name is nothing but a name in 'Romeo and Juliet,' by William Shakespeare. \nEver since the erstwhile Bombay metropolis was rechristened Mumbai, the chauvinistic wave caught on in the country, with a flurry of name changes, Madras to Chennai and Calcutta to Kolkata being prominent examples. In the case of Kolkata, there was justification for the change, as the original 'Kalikata' was derived from the Bengali word 'Kali Kshetra' meaning \"Holy Ground of Goddess Kali.\" Not so, however, in the case of Bombay. Shiv Sena, the ruling party in Maharashtra state saw that name as a legacy of British colonialism, and wanted to rename it to reflect the Maratha Heritage, and to pay tribute to Goddess Mumba Devi. Not a restoration of historical fact, as in the case of Kolkata. The change in the case of Madras to Chennai was also not a historical matter as Chenna Pattanam was the name of a nearby town, named by one Venkatadri Nayaka, in honour of his father Chennappa Nayakudu. \nHaving born in Chennai, I have, despite the most diligent effort, yet to come to terms with the changes in many names of the roads, streets and areas in that city. Mount Road, Madras, for example, has a nostalgic and familiar ring to most people of my generation. A roadway dotted with many landmarks, such as the Midland theatre, the Buhari restaurant and the New Elphinstone theatre (in the ground floor of which was a soda fountain, where one could savor delicacies such as Peach Melba and ice cream soda). As one continued along the road, a point came where Sir Thomas Munro's statue, on horseback, was the landmark where one turned left towards either the Madras Central railway station or the General Hospital, straddling the Grand Western Trunk road. Less than a hundred yards from there, was the Moore market, now demolished to make way for the MGR Central Station. One remembers the exciting visits to Moore Market as a child, where my father used pay special attention to secondhand books lying on the pavement on the roadside; and many types of curios and toys, new and used were available. \n And as the renaming virus spread, and reached the capital city, we now have the erstwhile Rajpath becoming Kartavya Path to mention just one example. And in Hyderabad, James Street is now Sardar Patel Road and Kingsway, Mahatma Gandhi Road. \nIn the Telugu speaking states, while Hyderabad has, so far, survived an attempt to rename it Bhagya Nagar, Vijayawada and Rajahmundry have been fortunate in reacquiring their original names, namely Bejawada and Rajamahendravaram. As has Kakinada, which the Britishers called Coconada. Not renamed as such. Only correcting the inability of the British to pronounce the names correctly. Just as Singapore was originally Simhapuri, or Kampuchea wasKambhoja. \nMany cities and towns in America carry the names of places originally in England, where the forefathers of their present citizens came from. Boston, for instance, the capital of Massachusetts State, is the most expensive place in the United States, but its UK counterpart is just a quiet coastal town in England's east coast. Likewise, there are three American cities named London in Arkansas, Kentucky and Ohio respectively. London one in Kentucky hosts the World Chicken Festival annually. New York gets its name from York, the county town of Yorkshire a Cathedral city, one of England's most historic urban areas founded by the Romans in the year 71 AD. And, unlike its counterpart in England, which is home to the most famous academic institutions in the world, Oxford, in America, is just a sleepy New England town, on the banks of Thompson Lake. \nWhether it was 'Porus,' who fought 'Sikander,' who invaded India, or they were actually called 'Purushottam' and 'Alexander the Great,' does not change the historical fact, that the battle of Hydaspes took place on the banks of Jhelum river in the Punjab region, and that a close study of unbiased historical accounts shows that the great conqueror was humiliated, defeated and sent back. \nSome authors, painters and sculptors are also in the habit of using what is called 'nom de plume,' postpaid or a pen name, in order to conceal their identity, either to avoid publicity, or for others reasons of convenience. The legendary BPR Vittal, a senior civil servant and noted economist of undivided Andhra Pradesh State, used to write under the pen name 'Nirbhayam (or 'fearless)'. His equally eminent son, Sanjay Baru, the noted author of 'The Accidental Prime Minister' about Dr Manmohan Singh, formerly Prime Minister of India, writes a column called 'Sanjay Uvacha,' the title being a reference to Sanjaya of Mahabharata relating the happenings in the Kurukshetra war to the blind Duryodhana. \nThe whole point being made is that, once a place has been given a name, and things have happened there, changing the name, or artificially altering the nature of what really happened, cannot undo historical truth. The best thing is to learn lessons from what happened, in order to improve the chances of sustainable development, and rapid growth, of the world economy in the future. We must learn to possess, the courage, and boldness, to live with memories of unpleasant past happenings, treating them as a learning ground for the future. \nWhen a scar formed as a result of an injury sustained in childhood, it is often seen, that years later, the brain 'mimics' the pain, although the wound had healed long ago and the physiological cause for that pain is no longer obtaining. Unpleasant memories of past happenings are precisely like that. The scars remain, though the wounds healed long ago. The thing to do, therefore is to treat the scar as something that cannot be wished away, but as a reminder of an experience that has made a person the better for it. \nWhen all is said and done, even if the whole world calls it Parr-ees, the correct pronunciation of Paris is Pah-gee, with the 'g' pronounced with the bottom of the tongue touching the top of the roof in the mouth, a sound other languages are not accustomed to in their phonetics. Similarly even if all of us call it Thay-mes, the river's name really is Tems, just as Sir Thomas Munro ought to be called Sir Tomas Munro. Why, I, myself, have been called by various names such as Mohan, Babu, Ayya or Sir depending on the context and situation. But I remain I, the names used by others notwithstanding! \n \n(The writer is former Chief Secretary, Government of Andhra Pradesh)\n(The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

{"title": "Is India slowly turning into a nation of drug addicts?", "date": "3 Oct 2022 1:21 AM GMT ", "description": "A spate of large seizures of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances in 2021 and 2022 must be an eye opener to the law enforcement agencies, particularly the NCB (Narcotics Control Bureau), the DRI (Directorate of Revenue Intelligence), the customs, Coast Guard and the Border Security Force.\nExactly 14 days after the Taliban took control of Afghanistan on 1st September, 2021, the DRI detained two containers at Adani's Mundra Port. The containers had come from Kandahar via Bandar Abbas on September 17 and the DRI seized 2,988 kg of heroin which was concealed in the lower layer of jumbo bags containing talc stones with an estimated value of Rs 21,000 crore in the international market. After investigation, 8 persons including 4 Afghans, one Uzbek 3 Indians were detained. Follow-up action was taken at Delhi resulting in seizure of 16.1 kg of heroin from a godown in Delhi and 10.2 kg of cocaine and 11 kg of Heroin. The case was handed over to NIA which carried out further investigation and filed a charge sheet on March 14 this year against 16 persons including Afghan and Iranian nationals, in Ahmedabad. \nThe drug smugglers had earlier reportedly imported 24 tonnes of heroin and placed it in the distribution network that is operational in several parts of the country. The drugs were transported by Truck No. RJ 01 GB 8328, allegedly owned by Jaydeep Logistics. In April 2021, the DRI seized 300 kg of cocaine from a container ship in Tuticorin Port which was concealed in a consignment of timber logs. \nIn March, 2021, the Coast Guard seized 300 kg of heroin, AK47 rifles and 1000 rounds of ammunition from three Sri Lankan vessels off the Coast of Lakshadweep. In November, 2020, the Coast Guard intercepted a Sri Lankan boat off the eastern coast of Tamil Nadu with 120 k. of Heroin. \nIn August 2020, the DRI, Mumbai unit had seized 191 kg of heroin, worth Rs 1000 crore in the international market, from a container at JNPT, Nhava Sheva. The contraband is said to be of high quality and suspected of having been sourced by operatives of an international narcotics-trafficking syndicate from Afghanistan. Jayesh Sanghvi, a businessman was arrested. \nOn 20.7.2017, 1500 Kg of Heroin were seized from SS Henry, a Panam\u00e1 registered ship by the Coast Guard off Gujarat Coast. In a joint operation of Gujarat ATS and the DRI seized 260 kg of heroin on 21.4.2022, from Kandla port, in Gujarat. \nThe above seizures are illustrative and are indicative of the demand for drugs in the country. Even assuming that a part of the drugs being smuggled into India are meant for re-export at higher prices to finance terrorist and other anti-national activities, still the situation appears to be alarming, keeping in mind that only a percentage of goods smuggled are seized by the law enforcement agencies. \nDocumented evidence indicates drug abuse is prevalent amongst the youth in several parts of the country particularly in Punjab, the North Eastern States, Goa and Metropolitan cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, etc. In Goa, the Russian Mafia is the biggest, well-organized and keeps low profile in their operations. They mainly cater to Russian tourists and are active around Arambol. The Nigerians have been active there for the last 5 years. The Israelis were once very active but their numbers have shown a sharp decline. The Indians also operate but in small numbers. \nThe routes being followed is from Columbia, Mexico , Nigeria, Dubai, Delhi, Mumbai, Goa and Bangalore. Drug cartels are sending large quantities to Delhi which is now known as the Cocaine Capital. West Delhi has become 'Drug Zone.' Delhi has been receiving higher quantities than Goa, Mumbai or Bangalore. The cost of heroin in Delhi has now increased to Rs 4 crore per kg. Nigerians have become the biggest players in India's drug market for hard drugs. Many of them overstay beyond the period for which visas are granted to them. \nA national survey conducted by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment in 2004 shows that there were 2 million addicts in the country. The second survey conducted in 2018-19 shows that there were 22 million addicts. If a projection is made for 2022, the number of drug addicts will not be less than 60 to 80 million. According to estimates by UNODC (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime), one sixth of world production of drugs is consumed in India. \nThe Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India in order to estimate the number of opioid dependent individuals in Punjab, in collaboration with the Society for Promotion of Youth & Masses and a team of researchers from the National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre, AIIMS, New Delhi, in collaboration with Department of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Punjab conducted 'The \"Punjab Opioid Dependence Survey', in February \u2013 April 2015. The survey found that there were 2.32 lakh \"drug dependents\" in Punjab. In other words 1.2% of the adult population (2 crore as per the 2011 census) is addicted to drugs. As for 'users', the survey estimated the number to be 8.6 lakh - which means 4.5% of all of Punjab's adult population has at least 'used' drugs. \nMost common opioid drug used by this group is heroin (53%), followed by opium/doda/phukki (33%). Rest (14%) reported using a variety of pharmaceutical opioids. About one-third take their opioid drugs through injecting route and among them almost 90% (29% overall), inject heroin. \nAmong various reasons reported for starting the use of opioid drugs, the most common reason was 'peer-influence' (75%). On an average, a heroin using individual spends about Rs. 1400 in a day on drugs, while this figure is considerably lower for opium users (Rs 340 per day) and pharmaceutical-opioid users (Rs 265 per day). A large majority reported suffering from physical, mental or social adverse consequences of drug abuse. While only a minority were arrested and jailed, almost everyone who had been to jail continued drug use, during incarceration. Almost 80% reported that they tried to give-up drug use in the past but just about 35% received any kind of help or treatment. \nThe medical treatment (which involves using medicines for treatment of withdrawal symptoms) has been received by just about 16% of opioid dependent individuals. Medicines which are required to be taken on a long term basis (also known as Opioid Substitution Therapy - OST), have been received by less than 10%. The drug-user profile of Opioid Dependent individuals in Punjab shows that heroin (53%) is the most common opioid drug; 33% use through injecting route and most of them (75%) started opioid use due to peer-influence. About 80% tried to quit and 35% of them received any help for quitting. \nThe survey estimated the size of opioid dependent population in Punjab to be 1,74,642 on the lower side and 3,22,416 on the upper side. It also found about 2.3 lakh dependent individuals and 'probable' 8.6 lakh opioid users. Amongst the addicts, the young males were disproportionately affected. Drug abuse casts a significant burden on society and the estimated annual expenditure on opioid drugs by dependent individuals is around Rs 7,500 crore. \n(Writer is former DG, DRI, \nDG, NCB and Member, CBIC; The concluding part of article \nwill appear tomorrow) ", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/opinion/news-analysis/is-india-slowly-turning-into-a-nation-of-drug-addicts-764028"},
{"title": "Silence! Don't talk about Civil War in Sri Lanka", "date": "1 Oct 2022 10:41 PM GMT ", "description": "A peculiar silence has always enveloped it. The image of Prabhakaran splashed across newspapers has continued to haunt not just Tamils across the world, but all those who followed the organisation and their cause closely. Surprisingly, not only the Sri Lankan government, but even filmmakers and artists have maintained a deathly silence over the three-decades-long civil war and human rights abuses in the island nation that claimed, according to the UN around 1,00,000 lives.\nSri Lankan filmmaker Visakesa Chandrasekaram feels that \"silence is to do with the fact that it is much uncomfortable for people to talk about it. Adding that there was an involvement of many, including people like him who did not do anything about it, he asserts that there is an underlying feeling of guilt that seldom leaves people of his generation.\" \n\"Thus, denial comes to the forefront, that these atrocities didn't happen...In fact, my third film is about that silence. And it is about ex-militants and how they were taken into custody. Some were not even extremists, they were just people at the wrong place at the wrong time. A lot of things happened to them in detention, but we do not talk about it. Only those who escaped to other countries talk about it because they are survivors in that country and the success of their political asylum application will be based on breaking the silence,\" Chandrasekaram, who has made films like 'Earth', 'Frangipani' and 'Finding Kamal' told IANS. \n'Frangipani' is a queer love story, set in a Sri Lankan village while 'Earth' is about a mother looking for her son who disappeared during the civil war. \"The third film revolves around an ex-militant who is returning home from the war. It will take time.\" In Chandigarh for the ongoing 'Indus Valley International Film Festival', this lawyer from Colombo may not have gone to film school, but has been learning on the job even before he finished high school. \"I started off as an assistant director when I was 17 years old, much before film schools opened in my country. However, I soon realised there was not much money in this profession and went back to school to study law. After several years, with the money I had saved, I started off with 'Frangipani' as no one had done justice to the theme of gay love in films in my country.\" \nAs his country goes through an economic meltdown, its already shaky film industry is not spared from its impact. Screens are down to 30 in the entire country and piracy continues as a major problem. \"The day a movie is released, people share it on the Telegram app. The saddest part is that most do not even realise that it is illegal.\" \nStressing that inaccessibility to OTT platforms is not doing any good to their cinema, the director feels that considering most films made in Sri Lanka are in Sinhalese language, their numbers are not high enough to warrant a new language option in OTT's language drop down menu. \nWhile several independent Indian filmmakers go in for international collaborations to tap into the European funding pool, Chandrasekaram feels that is not an option for Sinhalese films. \"India has a big market overseas. But our market is small and frankly, we are not really known for making good films, so nobody is really investing in our films,\" he concluded.

{"title": "A visionary, freedom fighter & reformer", "date": "23 Sep 2022 8:39 PM GMT ", "description": "The land of Telangana has given birth to great freedom fighters and social reformers. One of them was Pandit Gangaram Vanprasthi, who was truly dedicated to social reforms, empowerment of weaker sections of society, elimination of untouchability and discrimination in any respect. He was a great votary of the use of Hindi as a national language across the country.\nFrom his childhood, Gangaram Vanprasthi was always ready to help the needy or someone in distress. In 1933, as a school going child, he jumped into the river Godavari to save a child widow. Impressed, the Nizam of Hyderabad crowned him with the Shaurya Award. There are many such stories about him, which speak volumes of his will power and innate urge to serve the people, society and the nation. \nGangaram Vanprasthi's contributions to the liberation of Hyderabad were critical. He relentlessly fought for the freedom and development of Hyderabad. Recently, the Freedom Fighter Pandit Gangaram Memorial Foundation organised a function to commemorate the liberation of Hyderabad and pay tribute to Pandit Gangaram Ji. I was fortunate to be a part of the programme as the chief guest. \nThe liberation of Hyderabad is a red letter day in our history. On 17th September 1948, more than a year after India secured Independence from the British rule, the state of Hyderabad got its independence from the Nizam's rule. It was possible because of the resolute efforts of great souls like Pandit Gangaram ji. Similarly, his contributions to the creation of Telangana state were quite significant. \nI have many fond memories of Pandit Gangaram Ji. He was always worried about our people's wholesome growth. The reforms which he could introduce in society through his long and dedicated association with Arya Samaj were monumental and he wanted to continue them. Whenever we met, he used to share his vision as well as pain for the marginalized sections of society, which was indeed so touching. He was of the view that each one of us has a duty towards the nation and its people. \nTill the last breath of his life, Pandit Gangaram ji continued to promote Indian culture and values through Arya Samaj. I feel that his life conveys a very meaningful message to us \u2013 Where there is a will, there is a way! He faced multiple challenges and hardships but did not give and moved in his life with the mission to spread great Indian values among us. His fight against caste-based discrimination and untouchability was exemplary. He used to sit with our sisters and brothers whom our society considered as untouchables. He himself married a woman of different caste. Similarly, his children \u2013 two sons and one daughter \u2013 were married in different castes. Pandit Gangaram ji practiced in his life what he used to preach to others! He led his life by example. \nPandit Gangaram Ji firmly believed that the essence of freedom is linked to the people's ease of life, preserving our rich cultural legacy. Throughout his life, he fought for our core values as a nation \u2013 equality, justice, fraternity and liberty. In the past 75 years, we achieved a lot. Remarkable progress has been made in the past 8 years towards building a new Atma Nirbhar Bharat. Problem of poverty and unemployment is being tackled effectively. An inclusive Bharat where no one is left behind is our collective responsibility, and hence each one of us should contribute accordingly. \n As we are celebrating Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, the completion of 75 years of India as an independent nation, we need to tell our people in general and the children in particular, about our great freedom fighters like Pandit Gangaram ji and how to contribute in making the country as envisioned by them. Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav is focussed on five themes: Freedom Struggle; Ideas @ 75; Resolve @ 75; Actions @ 75 and Achievements @ 75. \nThe vision and philosophy of Pandit Gangaram ji are well-aligned with our collective resolve to make a new India, which is more inclusive, healthier and happier. By following his teachings and learning lessons from his sacrifices and ideals, we can certainly realise the dream of building a vibrant and robust India. It will also be a great tribute to Pandit Gangaram Vanprasthi ji.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/opinion/news-analysis/a-visionary-freedom-fighter-reformer-762912"},
{"title": "Avoiding urban heat islands", "date": "24 Sep 2022 7:48 PM GMT ", "description": "\"Modern\" styles of architecture using concrete and glass have often usurped local building techniques better suited to parts of the world with hotter climates. Now some architects are resurrecting traditional techniques to help keep buildings cool. From western Europe to China, North Africa and the US, severe heatwaves brought drought, fire and death to the summer of 2022. The heatwaves also raised serious questions about the ability of existing infrastructure to cope with extreme heat, which is projected to become more common due to climate change.\nYet, for thousands of years, people living in parts of the world used to high temperatures have deployed traditional passive cooling techniques in the way they designed their buildings. In Nigeria, for example, people have long used biomimicry to copy the style of local flora and fauna as they design their homes, according to Anthony Ogbuokiri, a senior lecturer in architectural design at Nottingham Trent University in the UK. But in the 20th century, cities even in very hot climates began following an international template for building design that meant cities around the world, regardless of where they were, often had similar looking skylines. Ogbuokiri calls this \"duplitecture,\" and says it \"ramped up the cooling load\" due to an in-built reliance on air conditioners. \nAlongside this, there was a massive boom in the use of concrete, particularly after the second world war when the Soviet Union and the US started gifting their cold war allies concrete technology. \"It was a competition both to discover who actually mastered concrete and who was better at gathering the materials, the people and the energy to make concrete,\" explains Vyta Pivo, assistant professor of architecture at the University of Michigan in the US. \nBut too much concrete can contribute to the phenomenon of urban heat islands, where heat is concentrated in cities. Concrete is also a considerable contributor to global carbon emissions. Some architects and researchers are working to rehabilitate and improve traditional passive techniques that help keep buildings cool without using energy. Susan Abed Hassan, a professor of architectural engineering at Al-Nahrain University in Baghdad, Iraq, focuses a lot on windcatchers in her work, a type of chimney which funnels air through houses to keep them cooler in hot climates. She's now looking at how to combining underground water pipes with windcatchers to enhance their cooling effects.

{"title": "We have just one life, don't fritter it away", "date": "27 Sep 2022 7:45 PM GMT ", "description": "Suicide is the act of intentionally ending one's own life, which is the cruellest form of killing. Most of the suicides happen impulsively during crisis unable to face or deal with life stresses like financial problems, failures, relationship break-ups, or chronic ailments. In addition, experiencing conflict, disaster, violence, abuse or loss of near and dear ones and a sense of isolation are strongly associated with suicidal behaviour.\nSuicidal thoughts also called as suicidal ideation is due to pressure or tension that results from a demanding situation. Many factors can increase the risk for suicide or protect against it. Stress can be physical, emotional, psychological or a combination of these. \nSuicide rate is alarmingly high among the youth especially students as they are not prepared or are not ready to accept failures or disappointments. As children grow into pre-teens and teenagers, it becomes challenging and impossible for parents to know their thoughts and feelings. Helping a grown-up child to come out of depression can be particularly difficult. They are adults but at the same time their minds are tender and delicate, so don't hesitate to reach out and help. Doing so can prevent a disaster. \nThe main cause of student suicides in India is forced career choices. Parents across all income groups irrespective of their financial status, are mortally scared and petrified about letting their children do anything other than engineering, medicine or other conventional courses. They have the awareness and prospects of new courses but acceptability is lacking. Humanities and social sciences are still considered as a poor cousin of science subjects, even though they offer brilliant, well-paid careers. We need to allow our children to dream and dream big. \nThe pressure entrance exams put on students is but one of many reasons for the increased pushback among students. It is very tragic and threatening even to think that one exam can make or break the life of a student. This is because the pressure was built up years prior to taking the exam. Students failing to qualify with the high cut-offs give up and are forced to take a drastic irrevocable step. \nIt is imperative and is the need of the hour that parents and teachers understand the caliber and ability of the children. Putting pressure and blaming them and pointing out at their failure only adds to their misery and suffering in silence. \nWhile signing up for college, having differences with professors for certain reasons, incurring huge debts made to support your education and after so much effort not fetching a considerable score, thereby falling from the good books of the faculty, only adds to the disappointment and humiliation. Bullying and peer pressure also add up to the pressure cooker to burst as there is no way to escape. \nSuicide is preventable and its prevention among students has not been addressed sufficiently due to lack of awareness of suicide as a major public health hazard. Added to this, it's a taboo in many societies to openly discuss it. It needs to be viewed as a multi-dimensional public and mental health problem, which is indirectly related to economical, individual, social, cultural, psychological and biological areas of a civilized society. Time has come where civil society needs to look at suicides as a grave concern and crisis of the country's system of education which includes curriculum and the like. \nThe new trend and prestige in the society is joining the IT sector. For this, you need to complete engineering at any cost. This means joining exam-oriented coaching 'factory.' These are honoured prisons for youngsters where their bodies, minds and souls are tamed. Economic inequality and not having adequate skills to secure a job is forcing the youth to blame themselves for their failure in getting their 'dream job.' Apart from this, you find people advising and lecturing youth, \"it is not that hard to taste success if you work hard enough,' so that the youth blame themselves for their failures. \nWhat is the purpose of life? We all agree that it is happiness and happiness alone. We can truly be happy by doing what we enjoy the most. It can be music. painting, sculpture or anything that is unconventional. Rabindranath Tagore, who was against conventional schools and the education system in his childhood, started Visva Bharati in Santiniketan, advocating teaching students in unconventional ways. We may not make our educational institutions like heaven for our children but we can try and make them places of pleasant atmosphere. Let them not be breeding death centers. It's not the failure of the youth but it is the society and the system that failed them miserably and driven them to a point of no return. \nAs far as students are concerned, remember failure is the condiment that gives success its flavour and aroma. There is no need to be depressed if you fail. Do not fear failure and fear the unknown. Take it as a fire in your belly and work to make your dreams come true. Take a dynamic role in your own development and steer the rudder of your own life. Make full use of your unique personality and potential. Face your fears with commitment, courage and conviction. Look at life with open mind and don't settle for life less than you are capable of living. \nGo where your heart leads you, don't long for superficial and material sources of happiness as money, big cars, or expensive jewellery. Companionship, contentment and inner peace are more important. I say live the life the way it is meant to be with family, friends and laughter. Life is priceless, no tag is attached. It takes you on many journeys, some you may not even remember. That's why you have to always live each day with a positive outlook and look at the bright side of things and live your life the way you want and live it to the limit. \nThe biggest act of kindness in this world remains the act of saving a human soul, especially YOUR OWN SOUL.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/opinion/news-analysis/we-have-just-one-life-dont-fritter-it-away-763353"},
{"title": "A favourite pastime for many of us", "date": "28 Sep 2022 7:12 PM GMT ", "description": "Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, as the President of India, used to have select movies screened in the exclusive theatre at Rashtrapati Bhavan. L K Advani, a former Deputy Prime Minister and now a senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, is also known to be very fond of movies. \nWith a shot at histrionics, in my childhood \u2013 both in the theatre and on the silver screen \u2013 I have always been interested in movies. I like to watch Telugu, Hindi and English movies. Though it has been a long time since I watched a movie in a cinema theatre, I had the opportunity of watching many of them, in all languages including English, in the auditorium at Andhra Pradesh Bhavan in Delhi. \nIn recent years, following the lockdown on account of the virus, I had the opportunity of watching many movies, of all varieties, than I ever did in the past. \nIt is only very recently that I came across the genre of biopics. They are informal films, based on the lives of famous persons, typically public or historical figures, dramatising the lives of those persons. They are non-fictional, and depict lives and times of famous persons. Among the movies I have watched are Jhansi Ki Rani, The Big Bull, Katha Nayakudu and Maha Nayakudu, Thalaivi, Gandhi, Mahanati, Yatra and Shabaash Mithu. The ones I have yet to watch are the once about M S Dhoni and Abraham Lincoln. \nAmong the ones I watched, easily the best was Gandhi, a period biographical film based on the life of Mahatma Gandhi, directed by Richard Attenborough, with Ben Kingsley delivering a stellar performance as Mahatma Gandhi. Beginning with the defining moment in 1893, of Gandhi being thrown off a South African train for being in a whites-only compartment, and concluding with his assassination in 1948, it is a very realistic and convincing depiction of the great leader's life. Gandhi's message of all faiths being equal in secular India is, in particular, stressed. No wonder the Telangana government recently decided to show the film to lakhs of schoolchildren, as part of the ongoing celebrations of the 75th year of the independence of India. The movie was also ranked by the British Film Institute as the 34th greatest British film of the 20th century. \n YSR was an unforgettable part of my civil service career, especially an account of the year and more we worked together as the Chief Minister and the Chief Secretary of the Andhra Pradesh State. Savitri, yesteryear heroine of the Telugu film industry, was a person with whom I had acted as a child star. Watching Mammootty play to perfection the role of YSR In 'Yatra' reminded me very much of days with YSR, as the period in which the film was placed, and the events covered by it, pertained to the time we worked together. Watching a brilliant portrayal of Savitri by the highly talented Keerthy Suresh in 'Mahanati' was an equally thrilling experience. \nTwo biopics were produced on the legendary NTR, matinee idol par excellence, and arguably one of the most charismatic political leaders of the world at his time. And I had had the privilege and honour of working in his office for close to two years. At his request, at that, as soon after he assumed office, he apparently, remembered the small role I had played as a child actor, in a very popular film of his, at the zenith of his career as a film star, He then recalled from Delhi, where I was working as the Secretary to the Vice-President of India, on deputation to the Government of India. I will remember that period as probably the best time in my career, given his affection for, and trust in, me, and the exciting and unprecedented sweeping sea-change that was taking place in the administrative and political culture of the state at that time. Out of the two movies about NTR's life, namely, Maha Nayakudu and Katha Nayakudu, I watched the former, though only in bits and pieces. I was shown a character in the film, though in the wrong context, and with the wrong designation. For several weeks afterwards I had a number of calls from friends and relatives swarm calls from friends and relatives. \nAnother remarkably well directed biopic, in recent times, was Thalaivi, the one about the life and times of J Jayalalithaa, a former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu and very popular actress, in her own right, earlier. Kangana Ranaut, playing the role of Jayalalithaa did a commendable job indeed. \nGiven my interest in the film field, and having seen many of her blockbuster movies, I was quite happy to have been asked to receive her, when she came to meet NTR to sign the Telugu Ganga project agreement. The project intended to a project for supply drinking water to (the then) Madras city and now Chennai, and also to irrigate agricultural lands in the Southern districts of (the then) Andhra Pradesh state. As we were travelling in the lift to the third floor in which NTR's office was located I said to Jayalalithaa, merely to break the ice, \"Madam, I had also worked in films as a child artist.\" She gave me a half smile, and said, \"how interesting!\" clearly indicating that she had no interest in the subject! \n'The Big Bull,' starring Abhishek Bachchan as Harshad Mehta, the yesteryear stock market manipulator, was very convincing and extremely realistic. Also of the same genre was the movie I watched recently about Mithali Raj, the legendary captain of the women's cricket team of India, with the lead role being played by Taapsee Pannu. The ups and downs of the career of the great cricketer were captured remarkably well, both by the script and the cinematography. \nOne movie I only have a vague memory of having watched, in my childhood, is 'Jhansi Ki Rani' with the lead role played by Mehtab. Another version, released in 2018,had Kangana Raut playing the lead, as Manikarnika (Jhansi), is one I have yet to watch. \nTwo other movies I have yet to watch, but would like to very soon, are about M S Dhoni, one of the most popular players and captains of Indian cricket in all formats of the game, Tests, One Day Internationals and T20s, and Abraham Lincoln. The legendary and liberal minded President of United States from 1861 until his assassination in 1865, a great leader who led his nation through the civil war and succeeded in preserving the union, abolishing slavery, bolstering the federal government and modernising the US economy. 'The Untold Story,' the movie about MS Dhoni, is a Hindi language biographical sports drama about the great cricketer. I am particularly keen to watch this movie, not only on account of my being an aficionado of the game of cricket, but also my association with the administration of the game as a former President of the Hyderabad Cricket Association. Sushant Singh Rajput, who played the role of Dhoni, apparently had to go through a grueling training period of 18 months before the shooting began for the movie, and also had to watch many videos for hours together to pick up some of Dhoni's special points; in particular, the helicopter shot for which the legendary cricketer was famous. \nThe movie about Abraham Lincoln's life and times, titled 'Lincoln', has Daniel Day-Lewis playing the lead role. It depicts, in an arrestingly realistic fashion, the events pertaining to the life of Abraham Lincoln, Director Spielberg turned out another outstanding product, and the movie was nominated for as many as 12 Academy awards. \nA competition was going on for deciding who could best imitate Charlie Chaplin. Charlie Chaplin himself happened to pass by, and decided to enter the event as a participant. And came second! \n \n(The writer is former Chief \nSecretary, Government \nof Andhra Pradesh) \n(The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

{"title": "A catch-22 situation for India?", "date": "20 Sep 2022 6:36 PM GMT ", "description": "The recent visits to Taiwan by the US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and subsequently by a delegation of US Lawmakers have raised temperatures to a fever pitch, reigniting tensions between the US and China. Foreseeing a Chinese invasion, Taiwan is conducting its largest ever military drills which simulate the repulsion of an invading force.\nThere are indications of a possible military intervention by the US if China unilaterally takes action to breach the status-quo. While the global economy is still paying a hefty price for the Russian actions in Ukraine and COVID-19 pandemic, the dangers of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan will have far-reaching geo-economic and geopolitical consequences for India and the world. But what is so special about this tiny island that the Chinese are willing to wage a war against the mighty US military? And what are India's economic interests and political options in the event of an invasion of Taiwan? \nAfter a brief spell as a Dutch colony (1624-1661), Taiwan was annexed by the Qing dynasty of China in 1963. Following the first Sino-Japanese War in 1895, Taiwan was colonised again by the Japanese imperial rule. Finally, Japanese surrendered and gave up control over Taiwan in 1945 after their defeated in the World War II. \nConsequently, the governance of Taiwan was transferred back to the Republic of China (ROC) by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. However, in 1949, the Chinese communist armies defeated Nationalist forces on the mainland and established the People's Republic of China (PRC). The Nationalist government and armies fled to Taiwan, again resulting in the separation of Taiwan from China. The PRC government in Beijing has maintained that it has jurisdiction over Taiwan and has continued to propound a one-China policy. \nThe South China Sea (SCS) is bordered by several Southeast Asian nations, mainly, China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, Singapore and Vietnam. This sea holds tremendous strategic importance for its location since it is the connecting link, known as the Strait of Malacca, between the Indian and the Pacific Oceans. \nAccording to the UNCTAD, SCS accounts for one-third of global maritime trade, carrying an estimated US $3.37 trillion worth of trade every year. The SCS is estimated to have 11 billion barrels of untapped oil and 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, as per Council on Foreign Relations. \nAs estimated by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Philippines, SCS has one-third of the world's marine biodiversity. Importantly, the country that will control this maritime route will have substantial military advantage over rest of the world. China's keenness to unilaterally control SCS is evident from the fact that it has been conducting military surveillance, constructing ports, military installations, airstrips, and even building artificial islands. \nTaiwan is the unmatched leader of the world's semiconductor industry, singularly holding 63% of the global foundry market share, followed by South Korea (17%), and China (6%). In fact, in the first quarter of 2022, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has emerged as the world's largest chip manufacturer while alone commanding a global market share of 54%. It supplies chips to major technology firms such as Apple, Intel, Nvidia and major car makers around the world including Volkswagen, Ford, Toyota motors, and so on. \nFurthermore, replicating the manufacturing of semiconductors are extremely costly, tedious and time-consuming process. In 2021, the world witnessed a massive shortage of chips(primarily due to an ease in COVID-19 restrictions, sudden surge in demand, and disruptions in global supply chain) and realised its mammoth dependence on Taiwan. \nIndia's economic vitality rests on assured supply of energy and secure trading routes in the SCS, including the Straits of Malacca. India uses the SCS waterways for trade worth nearly US $200 billion each year. Nearly 55% of India's trade with the Indo-Pacific region pass through these waters, making SCS a significant geo-economic water body for the country. \nFurther, the Taiwan Strait is the primary shipping route between Japan, China, Taiwan and (much of) South Korea, carrying goods from the East Asian factories to the global market. India has comprehensive economic partnership agreements with Japan and South Korea, and recently signed an economic cooperation and trade agreement with Australia. India is at a very nascent stage in facilities for designing and manufacturing chips. This is also impeding India's 'self-reliance' when it comes to electronics manufacturing. In December 2021, India and Taiwan started negotiations on free-trade agreement focusing on developing India into a semiconductor manufacturing hub. If China invades Taiwan, it will have an insane control over a plethora of resources, a strategic military advantage, and a dominance over the US $3.37 trillion trade route as compared to India. \nIn more recent times, there has been a palpable change in India's stance over the sovereignty of SCS dispute, especially after Galwan Valley clash in 2020. India has maintained that SCS is a part of global commons and that there is a need to ensure freedom of navigation and unimpeded lawful commerce in this region. India should asseverate similar stance for Taiwan Strait and move back from the policy of a studied silence. If India seeks to engage with the prosperous Indo-Pacific region, it will be affected by the US-China friction over Taiwan. While many experts have argued that this is not India's battle to fight, India needs to wake up to the reality that Taiwan's security is critical to its own security and that of the Indo-Pacific region. In the face of this catch-22 situation, it's about time India strengthens economic ties and scales up diplomatic relations with Taiwan.\n(Dash is an Assistant Professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar and Mishra is an Assistant Professor at the Administrative Staff College of India, Hyderabad)", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/opinion/news-analysis/a-catch-22-situation-for-india-762477"},
{"title": "An ode to Federer's grace and Serena's class!", "date": "27 Sep 2022 8:15 PM GMT ", "description": "Tennis world will remember September 2022 as the meanest month for the decision of two legendary players- Roger Federer and Serena Williams- to call it quits after entertaining sports lovers for over a quarter century. The swashbuckling odyssey of the two all-time Tennis greats remains a sweet memory for sport enthusiasts across the globe for the powerful impact they left on the sports stream of human history. Roger proved himself as an epitome of technical acumen and graceful behaviour, while Serena is remembered as an unbelievable fighter against all odds, on and off court. The iconic quadragenarians are an amazing gift to the world from the sports cultures cultivated by their respective countries, Switzerland and the United States of America. \nBorn at Basel in Switzerland to his Swiss-German father and Afrikaner mother on 8 August 1981, Roger Federer rose to become the God of Tennis from a ball boy at his hometown tournaments. Tennis is one of the Swiss' top four sports besides football, ice hockey and skiing and the culture of sport nourished a champion material. Before becoming a professional Tennis player, he relished Badminton and Basketball. Switzerland, with a long history of tennis going back to real tennis in the middle ages, quickly took to lawn tennis to its heart and imbibed in its sports culture. Way back in 1989, the Swiss Open, a clay court tournament, was founded. Federer's discipline must have come from the compulsory military service he carried in the Swiss Armed Forces as a youngster. He was ruled 'unsuitable' and got relieved from the military obligation in 2003. A Wimbledon junior champion in 1998, Federer won his first major singles title at Wimbledon in 2003 at 21. Soon he earned a place among the unconquerable trio, called 'Big Three', along with Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. He was ranked world No-1 for 310 weeks, including a record 237 consecutive weeks, and finished as the year-end No-1 as many as five times. He won 103 ATP singles titles, the second most of all time, including 20 Grand Slam singles titles, a record eight men's singles at Wimbledon. \nOne of the Tennis' greatest rivals, Federer and Nadal, who bagged 42 Grand Slams (20 and 22 respectively) represented the Golden Era of Tennis and they played each other 40 times. They continued their friendship and mutual respect since junior days. Both entertained fans and sobbed together like kids when the former left from the professional competition at Lever Cup in England last week. \"When Roger leaves the tour, yeah, an important part of my life is leaving too because all the moments he has been next or in front me in important moments of my life,\" Nadal rightly pointed out. \nOne of the takeaways for budding players from Federer, who mastered the art of gliding on the court, is maintenance of injury-free sports career, most of the time. He experienced some physical niggles and ailments but underwent arthroscopic knee surgery for a torn meniscus in 2016. He had to undergo three surgeries in 18 months in 2020 and 2021 and finally decided to take a complete break. \nFederer has a solid fan base in India and his love for India is well-known. \"I love India. I enjoy going there to visit and also to play. It's a vibrant country,\" once he said. Federer, who has been to India in 2006, 2014 and 2015, took part in the International Premier Tennis League (IPTL) in his last visit. Indian fans had the first-hand experience of Federer's magic when he played two matches at the Indira Gandhi National Indoor Stadium in New Delhi. In 2015, a controversy erupted after Federer shared a picture on Facebook that shows him unpacking a Team India jersey, with the hashtag #BleedBlue. \nFederer's humanitarian gesture in the form of activities taken under his own Foundation are widely appreciated. The Roger Federer Foundation morally and financially supports educational projects located in the region of southern Africa and Switzerland. His wife, Miroslava Mirka Vavrinec, also a former professional player, has been the pillar of his support and strength. A total family man and humanitarian, Federer personifies a complete human-being in every sense of it. \nOne of the most talented Williams sisters from the USA, Serena, born on September 26, 1981, had quit the game days before Federer's exit in the same month. She turned professional at 14 in 1995 and won her first grand slam title aged 17 at the 1999 US Open. More than her record 23 Grand Slam titles, won by any other woman or man during the open era, Serena revolutionised women's tennis with her brute power and athleticism into the game besides putting a stiff fight against racism and sexism. She made innumerable comebacks from various injuries, including from life-threatening pulmonary embolisms. Serena, strongly supported by her parents and sisters, proved her detractors always wrong. In fact, the best in her came out following the humiliation she endured due to belittling comments and negative observations of others. \"There were so many matches I won because something made me angry or someone counted me out. That drove me. I've built a career on channeling anger and negativity and turning it into something good,\" she rightly pointed out in the statement of her retirement. Serena was ranked World No-1 in singles for 319 weeks, including a joint-record 186 consecutive weeks, and finished as the year-end No-1 five times. \nSerena, who doesn't like the word 'retirement' per se, decided to 'evolve' away from tennis, toward other things that are important to her. She wants to focus on a venture capital firm named after her name besides growing her family. \nWhen I talk about the retirement of the two Tennis greats, invariably the India's most accomplished player and our own Hyderabadi, Sania Mirza, came to my mind. In a Cricket-frenzy country, Sania made a name for herself with her grit and determination. The only face of India's tennis, Sania has been brining laurels to the country for the past 19 years. She climbed to a career-high ranking of 27th in the WTA singles rankings in 2007, making her the first female Indian singles player to reach the top 100. In the doubles, Sania was the World No-1 in April 2015, becoming the female Indian tennis player to reach the summit. Like Serena, the 35-year-old Sania, winner of six Grand Slam titles, too crossed many hurdles to reach this level. Sania surprised her fans on January 19, 2022 with an announced that she would hang up her boots at the end of this year as her body was wearing down and the motivation and energy levels were also not the same. The announcement came after she lost the Australian Open women's doubles first round with partner Nadiia Kichenok against Slovenia's Tamara Zidansek and Kaja Juvan. The former World No-1 in doubles, Sania pulled out of the US Open due to an injury in her forearm and informed her fans that it would change some of her retirement plans. \nAll said and done, sports gift us legends to share joy through their journey. Every legend and every journey must come to an end at a point of time. Tennis has, for sure, lost its sheen and it may take some time to find a player with Roger-like elegance and Serena-type style. Let's wait and watch. \n(The author, a Ph.D. in Communication and Journalism, is a senior journalist, journalism educator, and communication consultant)", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/opinion/news-analysis/an-ode-to-federers-grace-and-serenas-class-763357"},
{"title": "Green hydrogen: Costs & safety critical", "date": "3 Oct 2022 10:39 PM GMT ", "description": "Hydrogen is used mainly to make chemicals such as fertilisers, and in oil refineries. Most hydrogen in the world today is made from natural gas or coal \u2013 methods associated with large carbon dioxide emissions. Developed countries are therefore looking to \"green hydrogen\" instead \u2013 produced using renewable electricity such as solar and wind power.\nGlobal hydrogen demand reached 94 million tonnes in 2021, and contained energy equal to about 2.5 per cent of global final energy consumption. Only about 0.1 per cent of current global hydrogen production is green, but big expansions are planned. New applications for green hydrogen are also envisaged. Green hydrogen currently costs much more to make than less clean types of hydrogen. Using it to produce the 180 million tonnes per annum of ammonia required globally for fertiliser production would have a severe knock-on effect on food prices. So it is difficult to see how this transition is going to occur. \nGreen hydrogen is made from water. Using renewable (\"green\") electricity, equipment called electrolysers separates the hydrogen from oxygen in water (H2O). The process is called electrolysis. Green hydrogen production emits no carbon dioxide, but the construction of renewable electricity infrastructure currently uses fossil fuels, which do emit carbon dioxide. Hydrogen has traditionally been made from non-renewable energy sources like coal (\"black hydrogen\") and natural gas (\"grey hydrogen\"). When these methods are combined with carbon capture and storage, the hydrogen produced is known as \"blue hydrogen.\" \nAlthough the costs of renewable power generation have been coming down, the cost of electrolysis is still not commercially competitive. Today, green hydrogen has an estimated energy equivalent cost of between $250 and $400 per barrel of oil at the factory gate, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. Future cost reductions are forecast but these are uncertain. Current oil prices are around $100 a barrel \u2013 much less than it would cost to use green hydrogen instead of conventional petroleum products. The costs of transporting hydrogen must be taken into account too. Unfortunately, the physics of hydrogen is against low-cost hydrogen transport. It is much more challenging than oil-based liquid fuels, liquefied petroleum gas or liquefied natural gas. Ocean transport of hydrogen has to be at very low temperatures (-253 C). \nBecause ammonia (NH3) is much easier and cheaper to transport than hydrogen, the International Renewable Energy Agency has recommended \"storing\" hydrogen in ammonia for shipping. But that requires additional equipment to put the hydrogen into ammonia and strip it out at its destination. These processes add costs of about $2.50-$4.20/kg (equivalent to $123-$207 per barrel of oil) according to the agency. Hydrogen is more difficult to handle than conventional fossil fuels. It is a colourless, odourless and tasteless gas, unlike conventional hydrocarbons. This makes leak detection more difficult and increases the risk of fire or explosion. Hydrogen fires are invisible to the human eye. \nHistorically, hydrogen has been controlled within factory perimeters and managed by trained people. The widespread introduction of hydrogen into society will require new measures and skills, including insurance, materials handling, firefighting and disaster management. \nConstruction of the first gigawatt scale green hydrogen project in Saudi Arabia has already started. Many of the pioneering projects will be built in the southern hemisphere, mostly in developing countries. This is because they are less densely populated and have better renewable energy resources (solar and wind) for generating the necessary electricity. Although this may sound positive for developing countries, there are big risks in developing hydrogen mega projects. They will have to balance these risks against the temptations of improved investment, employment and balance of payments. They would be wise to extract guarantees from their customer countries so as to avoid the injustice of the global south subsidising the global north as it transitions to cleaner energy. \n(Crompton is Visiting Adjunct Professor, African Energy Leadership Centre, Wits Business School, University of the Witwatersr, Johannesburg; and Douglas is Senior Lecturer, Africa Energy Leadership Centre, Johannesburg; The Conversation)", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/opinion/news-analysis/green-hydrogen-costs-safety-critical-764132"},
{"title": "'Dark data' is killing the planet", "date": "1 Oct 2022 10:39 PM GMT ", "description": "More than half of the digital data firms generate is collected, processed and stored for single-use purposes. Often, it is never re-used. This could be your multiple near-identical images held on Google Photos or iCloud, a business's outdated spreadsheets that will never be used again, or data from internet of things sensors that have no purpose.\nThis \"dark data\" is anchored to the real world by the energy it requires. Even data that is stored and never used again takes up space on servers \u2013 typically huge banks of computers in warehouses. Those computers and those warehouses all use lots of electricity. This is a significant energy cost that is hidden in most organisations. Maintaining an effective organisational memory is a challenge, but at what cost to the environment? \nIn the drive towards net zero, many organisations are trying to reduce their carbon footprints. Guidance has generally centred on reducing traditional sources of carbon production, through mechanisms such as carbon offsetting via third parties (planting trees to make up for emissions from using petrol, for instance). \nWhile most climate change activists are focused on limiting emissions from the automotive, aviation and energy industries, the processing of digital data is already comparable to these sectors and is still growing. In 2020, digitisation was purported to generate 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Production of digital data is increasing fast \u2013 this year the world is expected to generate 97 zettabytes (that is: 97 trillion gigabytes) of data. By 2025, it could almost double to 181 zettabytes. It is, therefore, surprising that little policy attention has been placed on reducing the digital carbon footprint of organisations. \nWhen we talk to people about our work, we find they often assume that digital data, and indeed the process of digitisation, is carbon-neutral. But that is not necessarily the case \u2013 we are in control of its carbon footprint for better or worse. To help reduce this footprint, we have introduced the idea of \"digital decarbonisation.\" By this, we don't mean using phones, computers, sensors and other digital technologies to reduce an organisation's carbon footprint. Rather, we are referring to reducing the carbon footprint of digital data itself. It is key to recognising that digitisation is not itself an environmental issue, but there are huge environmental impacts that depend on how we use digital processes in daily workplace activities. \nTo illustrate the magnitude of the dark data situation, data centres (responsible for 2.5% of all human-induced carbon dioxide) have a greater carbon footprint than the aviation industry (2.1%). To put this into context, we have created a tool that can help calculate the carbon cost of data for an organisation. Using our calculations, a typical data-driven business such as insurance, retail or banking, with 100 employees, might generate 2,983 gigabytes of dark data a day. If they were to keep that data for a year, that data would have a similar carbon footprint to flying six times from London to New York. Currently, companies produce 1,300,000,000 gigabytes of dark data a day \u2013 that's 3,023,255 flights from London to New York. \nThe rapid growth of dark data raises significant questions about the efficiency of current digital practices. In a study recently published in the Journal of Business Strategy, we identified ways to help organisations reuse digital data, and highlight pathways for organisations to follow when collecting, processing and storing new digital data. We hope this can reduce dark data production and contribute to the digital decarbonisation movement, which we will all need to engage with if net zero is to be realised. \nYou can even make a start yourself by deciding which photos and videos you no longer need. Every file stored on the Apple iCloud or Google Photos adds to your digital carbon footprint. \n(Jackson is Professor of Information and Knowledge Management, Loughborough University; and Hodgkinson is Professor of Strategy, Loughborough University, UK; The Conversation)", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/opinion/news-analysis/dark-data-is-killing-the-planet-763906"},

India was left to deal largely on its own with the increased danger of cross-border terror from the Pak-Afghan belt in Kashmir and elsewhere and the added threat to national security arising from the Sino-Pak axis that entailed military liaison between the two hostile neighbours of India. \nRussia's military operation against Ukraine added to the challenge for India, of steering its national strategy. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, however, this nation has successfully tackled the new demands on security and economic fronts facing the country \u2013 with consistency, clarity and a new-found political will \u2013 and enabled India to steadily emerge as a global power and in particular establish itself as an Asian giant. \nThe strategy that Prime Minister Modi formulated, with the able assistance of his NSA, revolved around a firm declaration that there will be no talks with Pakistan until the latter renounces use of terror as an instrument of state policy in respect of India, bilateral relations with all based on mutuality of security and economic interests, and special emphasis on India-US friendship as an expression of natural bonding between the two largest democracies of the world without prejudice to the valuable India-Russia relationship that has been built over years to serve, among other things, the need for India to have a dependable source of modern military equipment- \nRussia, in fact, has been the biggest supplier of arms to India in recent years. Besides, India has proved its total commitment to economic development of all in the interest of world peace. What is remarkable about this national strategy is that it rests on Prime Minister Modi's personal equation with both US President Biden as well as Russian President Vladimir Putin. This has enabled India to play the role of a global counsel in the sensitive geopolitical situation created by the prolonged Ukraine-Russia conflict, in which the US and Europe have both got deeply involved in support of Ukraine. \nIt is in this context, Prime Minister Modi's participation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit at Samarkand in Uzbekistan, where Iran joined in the group of Russia, China, India, Pakistan and the four CARs, established the stature of India as a world power and as a major influence on global geopolitics. \nThis happened since India kept Pakistan and China in their place, used the bilateral meeting between Putin and Modi to further strengthen their mutual ties while maintaining the stand that the Ukraine-Russia military conflict should end and peace negotiations should resume, pushing economic cooperation in the region on top of the agenda. \nAt the summit, Modi projected India as a great supporter of SCO, reminding the participants that the group accounted for 40 per cent of the world population and 30 per cent of the global GDP, and focused primarily on India's potential as a resurgent economy for contributing to the economic cooperation among the member countries. \nSpeaking of the food and energy security, he referred to the disruption of global supply chains due to the Covid pandemic as also the Ukraine-Russia military conflict and highlighted the need for establishing connectivity among the member nations through grant of transit facility \u2013 drawing attention indirectly to the impediment caused by Pakistan to the efforts of India to rush food supplies and humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. \nModi also gave a call for enhancing food security by promoting production of millets following the example of India. \nA great outcome of the SCO summit was the in-person bilateral meeting between Putin and Modi that further cemented Indo-Russian bonds. This happened even as Modi maintained that \"this is not an era of war\" and repeated his call for peace negotiations between Ukraine and Moscow to end the conflict since, according to him, the world favoured \"democracy, diplomacy and dialogue.\" \nPrime Minister Modi's stand on Ukraine-Russia conflict remains consistent with the view that concerns of both sides have to be addressed - it establishes India's wise counsel, retains the trust of the conflicting sides in India's Prime Minister and does not adversely affect Indo-US friendship. \nThe handling of Indo-Russian relations has a bearing on India's strategy of tackling a hostile China. India is prepared to deal with PLA on the borders, is actively engaging with Quad to check Chinese aggressive designs in the Indo-Pacific and thus safeguard Indian Ocean too. \nIndia's approach to the Ukraine-Russia conflict helps to ensure that China-Russia bonds do not affect India's national security interests. India does not mind omission of any reference to the relevance of the application of UN Charter in the context of Ukraine-Russia conflict in the joint statement of the summit, since a direct negotiation between the two sides, possibly with the informal help from a mutually acceptable friend like India, would be better than a formal third-party intervention there. \nAlthough India did not show any keenness for a bilateral meeting between China and India at Samarkand, President Xi for his own reasons publicly welcomed India as the host of next year's SCO summit. India has a lot to feel satisfied about the joint statement of the summit called Samarkand Declaration. \nThe statement advocated respect for the rights of people to independently and democratically choose political and socio-economic development and reaffirmed the principles of mutual respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of states, non-interference in internal affairs and non-use of threat of force, as the basis for sustainable development of international relations. \nImportantly for India, it held that the most important factor for improving and strengthening security and stability in the SCO region is the speedy settlement of the situation in Afghanistan by way of providing an inclusive government there and making it free of terrorism and drugs. \nIndia has every reason to feel happy that its stand on both economic development of the world and international security was fully vindicated at the SCO summit. \n(The writer is a former Director of Intelligence Bureau.

{"title": "PFI fomenting internal insurgency", "date": "26 Sep 2022 7:45 PM GMT ", "description": "The National Investigation Agency (NIA), which was probing over 100 (Popular Front of India (PFI) members in connection with various cases, arrested 45 members in raids across the country on September 22. The PFI was under the watch of the central security agencies for long as its cadres were deeply involved in indoctrinating young Muslims and receiving funds from foreign-based entities for waging war within India.\nLocal police forces and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) are also probing allegations that the PFI was 'funding' the 2019 anti-CAA protests and the 2020 northeast Delhi riots. Additional charges are terror funding and helping illegal Rohingyas and Bangladeshi migrants to sneak into India. Its footprints can be found in the pan-India protests against the National Register Census (NRC) and Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) as well as the hijab row in Karnataka. \nThere is a lot of evidence that the PFI has roots in the banned SIMI (Students' Islamic Movement of India) with many other organisations associated with it in various programmes, such as the Huda Islamic Center, Amity Peace Foundation, Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, Indian Pravasi Council (Oman), etc. \nMany political parties too have been alleged to be associated with the PFI, such as Milli Etihad Parishad (West Bengal), AMMK Party (Tamil Nadu), CPM (Kerala), Ambedkarite Party of India (Rajasthan) and so on. The Uttar Pradesh police, which is investigating over 19 cases against the PFI members filed in connection with the unrest reported in the aftermath of the Hathras case in September 2020, has accused the PFI of \"sedition, conspiracy, disturbing peace and promoting religious hatred.\" \nSince its creation in 2006 post-Babri-Masjid demolition, with the merger of three Muslim interest groups, PFI's presence has stretched to 23 states, according to the NIA. It identifies itself as a \"neo-social movement\" with a vision to empower all marginalised sections in India. Several of its co-founders were originally SIMI cadres, hence the connection. E. Aboobacker, president of PFI's political wing Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), headed the SIMI's Kerala unit from 1982 to 1984, while Professor P Koya, a member of the PFI's national executive, was a founding member of both SIMI and the NDF. PFI vice-chairman E M Abdul Rahiman was a SIMI general secretary between 1982 and 1993. \nYet, the members refute the connection to SIMI arguing that the banned outfit's solution to the Indian Muslim community's problems against \"the rising tide of Hindutva\" was Islam only whereas PFI believes India is a pluralistic country with many religions. This is seen by many Muslims simply as changing colours to lie low and out of the government's and security agencies' eyes. It even has a general secretary by the name of Mohammad Ali Jinnah, who refutes the ED's (Enforcement Directorate) claims that the PFI had funded the agitation against the CAA in various parts of the country. \nThe chargesheet has a long list: contact with Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) scholar Umar Khalid; providing funds to suspended Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor Tahir Hussain \u2013 under arrest for his alleged role in the Delhi riots; link to the Tablighi Jamaat, the Islamic organisation which faced criticism for holding a religious congregation at Delhi's Nizamuddin Markaz during the peak of the first wave of Covid infections; 2019 Mangaluru violence in which two people were killed in anti-CAA protests; gold smuggling through diplomatic baggage addressed to the UAE consulate-general in Thiruvananthapuram; carrying out \"forced conversions\" in Kerala's Malappuram; organising a terror camp in Kannur in 2013; running institutes where young people are indoctrinated; recovery of bombs, IEDs and swords from the same camp; and the most heinous of all the chopping off of a Professor TJ Joseph's palm in Kerala's Idduki on false charges of blasphemy; and, the murders of various RSS and ABVP workers in South India. Despite refuting all the above charges, Ahmed Shareef, the founder member of PFI, said in its mouthpiece 'Gulf Thejas' that, \"After making India an Islamic state, the PFI will go to other countries.\" \nIt is clear that India has an internal insurgency going on for several decades and that various Middle Eastern Wahhabi-inspired nations are willing to fund this insurgency. The coming weeks should reveal more about this.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/opinion/news-analysis/pfi-fomenting-internal-insurgency-763196"},
{"title": "Russia moving closer to autocracies", "date": "25 Sep 2022 7:17 PM GMT ", "description": "Russia is planning to buy \"millions\" of Soviet-era weapons from North Korea, a recent US intelligence report revealed. Britain's defence intelligence has also confirmed that Russia is already using Iranian-made drones in Ukraine. The revelations follow a series of diplomatic exchanges between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un to celebrate North Korea's Liberation Day on August 15. The two leaders proposed a new strategic and tactical cooperation, and stressed the tradition of friendship between them, part of a recent Putin offensive to create and strengthen alliances with key authoritarian states.\nIn just a few days, Putin met China's President Xi Jinping and Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi, promising a major trade delegation to Iran. Putin also promised to do everything he could to make Iran a full member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a political and security alliance that includes Russia, China, Uzbekistan and Pakistan. \nAs Russia becomes isolated from the west following its invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin is becoming more ideologically extreme, and is seeking to improve its cooperation with rogue regimes, particularly North Korea and Iran. This alliance, which is likely to include China, could pose a real threat to the west in the coming years. \nMoscow enjoyed a close diplomatic relationship with Pyongyang during the Cold War, and the Soviet Union was one of North Korea's most important economic partners. The relationship changed dramatically in 1991 when the Soviet Union collapsed. Russia, no longer a communist country, focused on forging a positive relationship with western democracies. It prioritised economic relations over ideological ones, and sought to develop closer ties with the United States and South Korea. This damaged its relations with Pyongyang, and North Korea shifted its focus to developing a closer relationship with China. \nWhen Putin came to power in 2000, he made attempts to renew Russia's diplomatic relationship with North Korea. Kim Jong-Il, Kim Jong-Un's father, even visited Russia on a few occasions. However, the relationship was hindered by Russia's deeply pragmatic approach to foreign policy. To maintain friendly relations with the west, Kremlin continued to condemn Pyongyang's nuclear programme. This made it impossible for the two states to develop meaningful diplomatic relations. \nRussia's economic and political isolation following its invasion of Ukraine provided a fresh opportunity for the two regimes to renew their ties. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, North Korea has become increasingly reliant on Beijing, with the vast majority of its trade and energy coming from China. \nHowever, this relationship is not free from political tension. China's key goal in the Korean Peninsula is to avoid the collapse of North Korea's autocratic regime and prevent a reunification with South Korea. This would be unacceptable to China, because it fears that a united Korea would bring greater US involvement in the region. As a result, China has been pressuring Pyongyang to become more moderate, hoping to stabilise the regime. The strained relationship between Beijing and Pyongyang is one reason why Kim Jong-Un is likely to embrace the opportunity to get closer to Moscow and become more independent from Beijing. \nA closer relationship between the world's most dangerous autocracies should be a stark warning to the west. Russia's interest in North Korea and Iran might be self-interested, it also signals that Moscow is no longer concerned with maintaining diplomatic relations with the west, and that it may be positioning the SCO as a rival to Nato. This autocratic bloc is almost certainly going to include China, whose relations with Russia deepened in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. There is some evidence that Putin's strategy is already working. In June, both Russia and China vetoed a UN resolution to impose new sanctions on North Korea as a result of its nuclear activities. This was an unprecedented move from two permanent members of the UN Security Council, who had condemned North Korea's activities in the past. \nTo counter a growing alliance of authoritarian regimes, the first step for the west is to acknowledge this is not necessarily a sign of Russian weakness, and not to rule out talks with the Kremlin. While diplomatic engagement with these states might become increasingly difficult, engagement is preferable to a policy of isolationism, which risks encouraging more autocratic cooperation. The west must remain robust in its defence of democratic values and position itself as a necessary economic and strategic partner to autocratic regimes, or risk driving them further away. \n(The Conversation) ", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/opinion/news-analysis/russia-moving-closer-to-autocracies-763124"},
{"title": "Foolish To Compare Patriots With Terrorists!", "date": "2 Oct 2022 7:16 PM GMT ", "description": "After the ban of Popular Front of India (PFI) and its sister organisations chest-beating in chorus among the Muslim vote dependent political parties along with their drum beaters has suddenly escalated. This reaction has been in line with the political observers' assessment. Let these terrorist, extremist and Jihadi forces cry from the roof top and hurl threats of mass violence and anarchy, gone are the days of brow-beating the governments of the days which succumbed to such inane threats of anti-national elements. Today, the nation solidly stands behind the government, thereby boosting its morale to crush mercilessly such unwanted elements.\nObviously, no country worth its name can tolerate the elements like PFI and the like who despite having been given a long rope to mend the ways did not for all these years since 2014. Starting from the Award-Wapsi gang, to Tukde-Tukde chorus to Kashmir Mange Azadi rhetoric , culminating into the grand gala shows of Shaheenbagh and sinister Tikait-led farmers' protests on non-issues, not to speak of Delhi violence followed by discredited splinter group of Khalistanis, were attempts to destabilise the country and create chaos . But alas, the dreams of the anti-national forces did not come true, thanks to the forbearance of the people and unflinching trust in the government of the day. \nTruly as the responsible government, the Union of India did its elaborate homework before cracking down on the PFI and company. The ED, CBI, IT, NIA etc; burnt midnight oil to gather clinching evidence which will be suffice to prove the cases slapped on the dreaded criminals and ensure their rightful place, that is, prison. \nComing to the uniform reaction of almost all opposition parties that if the PFI could be banned, why not the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh (RSS) too! \nSuch a demand, to say the least is ridiculous. The PFI and its supporters know it well that it the RSS is a formidable force of patriotic, nationalist elements with a vast organisational structure which sends shivers in the pants of the anti-national terrorist elements. Whenever the RSS has struck on such elements it is rather in retaliation to the terror unleashed by PFI supported and sponsored organisations. The constructive and humanitarian activities undertaken by the RSS and its front organisations has no parallel. Hence, there could be no comparison between the PFI and RSS. Needless to say that PFI nurtures an agenda to Islamise India with the international Jihadi outfits such as ISIS, Lashkar-e- Toyiba etc; while the RSS is a purely home breed organisation to protect sovereignty, integrity, liberty and unity of the people irrespective of their religion, caste, creed, language or race. \nCertainly, the Constitutional guarantees are not available to those who put their religion above the Constitution, consider the non-believers of their religion as infidels or Kafirs and exhort the religious fanatics to indulge in violence. Unfortunately, leaders like Asaduddin Owaisi to whose credit is a tag of the 'Best Parliamentarian' and a coveted Bar-At-Law qualification, close their eyes to the aforementioned caveats to qualify for the protection of the Constitution. When he quotes selectively and randomly from a judgment of the Supreme Court of India which states that mere association with a banned organisation does not make a person liable for the punishment, Owaisi is partly right but the other part which he too, pretty well knows and therefore, conveniently avoids mentioning is that the law does not come to the rescue of the outlaws. A person or an organisation which has a proclaimed stand of converting India into Gazwa-e- Hind and minces no words in enforcing its violent agenda towards fulfillment of this goal, cannot take shelter under the Constitution and the apex court's judicial pronouncements. It would be akin to a Shaitan quoting from the holy scriptures. \nEmphasising upon Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Supreme Court has said that it confers a valuable right upon an accused to establish his innocence and can well be considered beyond a statutory right, as a constitutional right to a fair trial under Article 21 of the Constitution. \nDelivering the judgment in appeal in a case titled, Jai Prakash Tiwari Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, a three judge bench comprising the then CJI N V Ramana, Justice Krishna Murari and Justice Hima Kohli said that a reasonable opportunity entails putting all the adverse evidences in the form of questions so as to give an opportunity to the accused to articulate his defence and give his explanation. The court added that if all the circumstances are bundled together and a single opportunity is provided to the accused to explain himself, he may not be able to put forth a rational and intelligible explanation. Such exercises which defeat fair opportunity are nothing but empty formality. \nHolding that non-fulfillment of the true spirit of Section 313 may ultimately cause grave prejudice to the accused, the court allowed the appeal filed by an accused who was concurrently convicted under Section 307 of IPC and Sections 25 and 27 of the Arms Act. \nKarnataka High Court Justice Krishna S Dixit has recently observed that the Information Commission cannot let the undue delay caused by a Public Information Officer (PIO) in furnishing information as sought for, go unpunished. The court added that leaving the culpable delay to go with impunity strikes at the root of law. \nThe abovementioned observations came in a case titled, Sijo Sebastain Vs. Karnataka Information Commission & Ors. The petitioner averred that the information sought by him came to be furnished with a delay of about two years whereas his statutory appeal was disposed off by the State Information Commission was 'casually' closed, ignoring the enormous delay brooked by the PIO. \nTaking serious view of the matter, the court observed, \" Respondent-Commission being a statutory quasi judicial body cannot act like a maharaja or moghul, its functions being of public law character \" and imposed the maximum penalty prescribed under Section 20 of the RTI Act on the PIO directing him to pay the same along with Rs.10,000 towards cost to the petitioner. \nThe Telangana High Court will stream live court proceedings from October 10 that is, after the Dasara vacation. To start with, the live proceedings will be limited to the Court No.1, the Chief Justice's court. \nA full court farewell was given to Justice G Sri Devi on her retirement on September 28. Rich accolades were paid to her by speakers that included Chief Justice Ujjal Bhuyan, State Bar Council Chairman , Advocate General and the President of the High Court Bar Association.

{"title": "Putin's tactical nukes raise tensions", "date": "29 Sep 2022 6:38 PM GMT ", "description": " Tactical nuclear weapons have burst onto the international stage as Russian President Vladimir Putin, facing battlefield losses in eastern Ukraine, has threatened that Russia will \"make use of all weapon systems available to us\" if Russia's territorial integrity is threatened.\nPutin has characterised the war in Ukraine as an existential battle against the West, which he said wants to weaken, divide and destroy Russia. US President Joe Biden criticised Putin's overt nuclear threats against Europe. Meanwhile, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg downplayed the threat, saying Putin \"knows very well that a nuclear war should never be fought and cannot be won.\" \nThis is not the first time Putin has invoked nuclear weapons in an attempt to deter NATO. I am an international security scholar who has worked on and researched nuclear restraint, nonproliferation and costly signaling theory applied to international relations for two decades. Russia's large arsenal of tactical nuclear weapons, which are not governed by international treaties, and Putin's doctrine of threatening their use have raised tensions, but tactical nuclear weapons are not simply another type of battlefield weapon. \n \nTactical nuclear weapons, sometimes called battlefield or nonstrategic nuclear weapons, were designed to be used on the battlefield \u2013 for example, to counter overwhelming conventional forces like large formations of infantry and armor. They are smaller than strategic nuclear weapons like the warheads carried on intercontinental ballistic missiles. \nWhile experts disagree about precise definitions of tactical nuclear weapons, lower explosive yields, measured in kilotons, and shorter-range delivery vehicles are commonly identified characteristics. Tactical nuclear weapons vary in yields from fractions of 1 kiloton to about 50 kilotons, compared with strategic nuclear weapons, which have yields that range from about 100 kilotons to over a megaton, though much more powerful warheads were developed during the Cold War. For reference, the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima was 15 kilotons, so some tactical nuclear weapons are capable of causing widespread destruction. \nThe largest conventional bomb, the Mother of All Bombs or MOAB, that the U.S. has dropped has a 0.011-kiloton yield. Delivery systems for tactical nuclear weapons also tend to have shorter ranges, typically under 310 miles (500 kilometers) compared with strategic nuclear weapons, which are typically designed to cross continents. Because low-yield nuclear weapons' explosive force is not much greater than that of increasingly powerful conventional weapons, the US military has reduced its reliance on them. Most of its remaining stockpile, about 150 B61 gravity bombs, is deployed in Europe. The UK and France have completely eliminated their tactical stockpiles. Pakistan, China, India, Israel and North Korea all have several types of tactical nuclear weaponry. \nRussia has retained more tactical nuclear weapons, estimated to be around 2,000, and relied more heavily on them in its nuclear strategy than the US has, mostly due to Russia's less advanced conventional weaponry and capabilities. Russia's tactical nuclear weapons can be deployed by ships, planes and ground forces. Most are deployed on air-to-surface missiles, short-range ballistic missiles, gravity bombs and depth charges delivered by medium-range and tactical bombers, or naval anti-ship and anti-submarine torpedoes. These missiles are mostly held in reserve in central depots in Russia. \nRussia has updated its delivery systems to be able to carry either nuclear or conventional bombs. There is heightened concern over these dual capability delivery systems because Russia has used many of these short-range missile systems, particularly the Iskander-M, to bombard Ukraine. Tactical nuclear weapons are substantially more destructive than their conventional counterparts even at the same explosive energy. Nuclear explosions are more powerful by factors of 10 million to 100 million than chemical explosions, and leave deadly radiation fallout that would contaminate air, soil, water and food supplies, similar to the disastrous Chernobyl nuclear reactor meltdown in 1986. \nThe interactive simulation site NUKEMAP by Alex Wellerstein depicts the multiple effects of nuclear explosions at various yields. Can any nuke be tactical? Unlike strategic nuclear weapons, tactical weapons are not focused on mutually assured destruction through overwhelming retaliation or nuclear umbrella deterrence to protect allies. \nWhile tactical nuclear weapons have not been included in arms control agreements, medium-range weapons were included in the now-defunct Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty (1987-2018), which reduced nuclear weapons in Europe. Both the US and Russia reduced their total nuclear arsenals from about 19,000 and 35,000 respectively at the end of the Cold War to about 3,700 and 4,480 as of January 2022. Russia's reluctance to negotiate over its nonstrategic nuclear weapons has stymied further nuclear arms control efforts. \n \nThe fundamental question is whether tactical nuclear weapons are more \"useable\" and therefore could potentially trigger a full-scale nuclear war. Their development was part of an effort to overcome concerns that because large-scale nuclear attacks were widely seen as unthinkable, strategic nuclear weapons were losing their value as a deterrent to war between the superpowers. The nuclear powers would be more likely to use tactical nuclear weapons, in theory, and so the weapons would bolster a nation's nuclear deterrence. \nYet, any use of tactical nuclear weapons would invoke defensive nuclear strategies. In fact, then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis notably stated in 2018: \"I do not think there is any such thing as a tactical nuclear weapon. Any nuclear weapon use any time is a strategic game changer.\" The US has criticised Russia's nuclear strategy of escalate to de-escalate, in which tactical nuclear weapons could be used to deter a widening of the war to include NATO. While there is disagreement among experts, Russian and US nuclear strategies focus on deterrence, and so involve large-scale retaliatory nuclear attacks in the face of any first-nuclear weapon use. \nThis means that Russia's threat to use nuclear weapons as a deterrent to conventional war is threatening an action that would, under nuclear warfare doctrine, invite a retaliatory nuclear strike if aimed at the US or NATO. \n \nI believe Russian use of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine would not achieve any military goal. It would contaminate the territory that Russia claims as part of its historic empire and possibly drift into Russia itself. It would increase the likelihood of direct NATO intervention and destroy Russia's image in the world. \nPutin aims to deter Ukraine's continued successes in regaining territory by preemptively annexing regions in the east of the country after holding staged referendums. He could then declare that Russia would use nuclear weapons to defend the new territory as though the existence of the Russian state were threatened. But I believe this claim stretches Russia's nuclear strategy beyond belief. Putin has explicitly claimed that his threat to use tactical nuclear weapons is not a bluff precisely because, from a strategic standpoint, using them is not credible. In other words, under any reasonable strategy, using the weapons is unthinkable and so threatening their use is by definition a bluff. \n(The Conversation) ", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/opinion/news-analysis/putins-tactical-nukes-raise-tensions-763666"},
{"title": "Senior Professionals Should Care For The Budding Ones: HC", "date": "25 Sep 2022 7:23 PM GMT ", "description": "The Delhi High Court has at last, hit the bull's eye. Dealing with a PIL filed by one, Pankaj Kumar against Bar Council of Delhi and others, the division bench comprising Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramon Prasad appealed to the senior members of all professionals, such as law, accountancy, medicine, engineering, architecture etc; \" to ensure that the stipend that is paid to their juniors is enough for their juniors to evade the financial stress that accompanies the profession and allow them to lead a more dignified life.\"\nAdding that so far as the legal profession is concerned the senior lawyers must be more mindful about the financial background of their juniors and called for an empathetic approach considering the 'virtuosity of legal profession.' Expressing concern for junior professionals the High Court observed that the job opportunities were far too many which makes the competition arduous and the services of an individual dispensable. \nThe petitioner had voiced his grievance before the court stating that young lawyers are unable to arrange for their accommodation, food, travelling and other expenses due to lack of proper and consistent source of income, and therefore, a direction was sought to the Bar Council of India and the Bar Council of Delhi for providing a financial assistance of Rs.5,000 to the newly enrolled advocates during the initial years of practice. Though the court took judicial notice of the plight of the young advocates it declined to stretch the matter to encompass as a right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India and left the matter to the Bar Council of India and bar associations of the country to find ways and means to mitigate the plight of the junior professions. \nIndeed, the plight of the junior professionals in almost all fields is pathetic. To acquire specialised knowledge in a particular field besides relentless efforts and merit, a good deal of financial, social and personal loss has to be borne by a professional in making. Such budding professionals need assurance of a bright future despite the fact that there has been a mad race for achieving glory between the giants as well as pigmies. There has been no level playing field and added to that is a strong cartelisation which vehemently resists the entry of newcomers in the select few clubs. \nBy the hindsight, a thought must also be given to the necessity of designating a chosen few as \"Seniors\" in the profession. This practice being discriminatory and divisive deserves to be abandoned at once. It not only leads to over-burdening a litigant who has also to pay for the juniors but creates the feeling of supremacy of such designated seniors over juniors. One fails to understand when all advocates are regarded as the 'Officers' of courts, albeit sans monetary reward and all of them sail in the same boat, where is the need to create barriers among them. \nIn fact, a young professional is better equipped with the latest development in his respective field and better trained in the use of latest technology. Therefore, except the younger age, nothing goes against him vis-\u00e0-vis his elder counterpart. Further, there is no reason to blindly believe that all that is old, is gold. The history, including the recent, has been replete with intellectually immature, temperamentally unpalatable or short-tempered and money-wise exceedingly greedy for the self and thoroughly miser for juniors, seniors who deserve to be discarded sooner than later. If that is done by the decision makers, we would be able to get rid of the browbeating lawyer-mafia forcing the opening of gates of the Supreme Court in the midnight in a bid to save the life of a condemned gangster, threatening the judges of dire consequences, levelling baseless and defamatory charges of corruption on all and sundry in the judiciary, including the Chief Justice of India, indulging in the rhetoric of 'I will hang my gown' and subsequently wearing again and what not. \nMADRAS HC ON FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS \nIn an important judgment, the Madras High Court has held that a citizen's fundamental right to life and personal liberty do not cease to exist merely because he or she was imprisoned, convicted or detained. In other words, the police or investigating agencies from now on, will have to behave in a civilised manner and not treating the imprisoned, convicted or detained person as the helpless creatures at their mercy. \nIn a case titled, Manokaran Vs. State and Others. A bench of Justice S Vaidyanathan and Justice A D Jagdish Chandra where two women branded as bootleggers were kept in preventive detention illegally for four months and for their release a habeas corpus writ petition was filed, the court observed that under Article 21 of the Constitution, a citizen's right to life and personal liberty have been guaranteed and the same can be deprived of only in accordance with the procedure established by law. The court while ordering the immediate release of the two women from the police captivity, also directed the Tamil Nadu government to pay Rs 5 lakh each. \nNGT SLAPS Rs.2,180 CRORE AS COMPENSATION ON PUNJAB \nThe National Green Tribunal (NGT) on September 22 imposed the Environmental Compensation of Rs. 2,180 crore on the State of Punjab for failing to treat solid and liquid waste. \nA three-member bench presided over by Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said that it was a matter of concern that even after 48 years after the passing of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and expiry of statutory timelines under Solid Waste Management Rules, gaps continued to plague waste management in the State. \nThe NGT order comes in the wake of Supreme Court's directions in Almitra H Patel Vs. Union of India & Others and Paryavaran Suraksha Vs. Union of India which directed the NGT to monitor enforcement of solid and liquid waste management norms. \nInterestingly, Punjab is the fifth state after Maharashtra, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh to have been fined for improper waste management by the NGT in the recent past. \nAPEX COURT JUDGE INDIRA BANERJEE RETIRES \nThe 8th woman Judge of the Supreme Court of India, Justice Indira Banerjee retired on September 23.

{"title": "Bridging gaps in healthcare delivery", "date": "19 Sep 2022 7:46 PM GMT ", "description": "The arrival of the pandemic has significantly increased the Indian telemedicine market. Teleconsultations, e-clinics, and remote monitoring are now trusted and preferred by patients and healthcare professionals. Although e-clinics are a relatively new concept in India, they were created to increase health outreach in remote and difficult-to-reach areas of the country and provide primary health care services by connecting qualified allopathic doctors in cities with local practitioners and health workers who see patients using video conferencing technologies and cost-effective methods.\nIndia is not lagging behind in adopting telemedicine, which is making waves in the global industry. Furthermore, telemedicine is becoming a tool for closing the access to healthcare gap in India's rural and urban areas. Given the promise of digital health for efficient healthcare delivery, there is an urgent need to integrate it in the nation's most remote areas. Telehealth, in conjunction with the Government of India's telemedicine standards, has the potential to improve healthcare in rural areas. The market is rapidly expanding, which is assisting in the transformation of the healthcare industry from a provider-centric, volume-based paradigm to a patient-centric and value-based paradigm. \nThe need to deploy technology in rural areas where healthcare is scarce is becoming increasingly important as time passes. Given its current state of development, telemedicine faces numerous challenges. However, the benefits of improved broadband and telecommunications infrastructure are compelling enough for rural communities around the world to implement and adopt them. Telemedicine seeks to help healthcare facilities such as hospitals, clinics, and health centers improve patient access to care. It enables us to assist and provide healthcare services. Better monitoring and easier access to healthcare, made possible by technology, improve patient-doctor communication. It also employs electronic equipment and technology to communicate data and provide clinical assistance to patients. \nAlthough telemedicine has the potential to revitalize rural hospitals, challenges remain. People in other areas revert to their old habits, expecting to interact with healthcare systems in the same way they always have. Because of the established nature of their relationship, patients would prefer that their primary care physician participate in telemedicine. Some healthcare practitioners may find it difficult to learn new consultation techniques and may require advanced training to use cutting-edge technologies. \nThe primary barriers to telemedicine expansion in rural areas are fragmented healthcare and limited resources. The lack of primary healthcare services in India's rural areas influences the use of telehealth in these areas. They are unable to go digital because the public and experts are unaware of and reject new technologies. Due to difficulties such as patient misunderstanding of symptoms, physician misreading of symptoms, misdiagnosis, app usage, familiarity issues by technologically challenged people, cyber risks, and so on, rural populations continue to prefer over-the-counter doctor consultation and treatment. To overcome these barriers, we must spread the word that telemedicine is currently the safer and faster option; teach patients step-by-step how to use it; reach out to people with weak social networks and low technological literacy; lower the cost barriers to accessing telemedicine, and increase network reimbursement coverage for clinicians. \nTelemedicine programs have benefited rural populations over time. Although there are numerous advantages of using telemedicine in all settings, telemedicine programs are especially beneficial for providers addressing a wide range of issues confronting rural residents. \nAs technology progressed, various e-clinic platforms emerged as a trend for providing medical care on par with high-quality and cost-effective models. Through the telemedicine clinic platform, online telemedicine clinics connect rural patients with specialized doctors at a low cost. \nFurthermore, they contribute to quality consultations through video conferencing and telemedicine by meeting a wide range of medical needs. As a result, the e-clinic has accelerated rural telemedicine healthcare services. \nAs a result, rural telemedicine is in higher demand. Furthermore, it is becoming clear that government programmes and other healthcare providers are extending the healthcare ecosystem in rural and underserved communities by capitalising on the momentum created by telemedicine. \nThis introduces people to the benefits and convenience of telemedicine, expanding its use in remote locations and improving overall population health. Therefore, telemedicine helps to deliver healthcare throughout the rural ecosystem, making India's population healthier. \n(The author is CEO and Co-Founder, Tattvan E-Clinics)", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/opinion/news-analysis/bridging-gaps-in-healthcare-delivery-762386"},
{"title": "Securing IoT from view of a future battlefield", "date": "24 Sep 2022 7:46 PM GMT ", "description": "The most valuable and significant things in the contemporary digital world are Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Additionally, a subset of the IoT created for modern battle operations and intelligent warfare is known as the Internet of Military Things (IoMT), also known as the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT). It alludes to actual physical objects of a military calibre that are furnished with software, sensors, and other modern technologies. These items communicate with one another to gather and transfer data over the Internet in order to carry out a variety of tasks more accurately and quickly. \nSoldiers in the IoMT and IoBT use a variety of equipment, including combat suits, helmets, weapons systems, and other items. These sensors capture several biometrics, such as their face, iris, heart rate, motions, fingerprints, and facial expressions. In the modern world, military operations are becoming increasingly complex and unpredictable. IoT can help defence and military personnel respond appropriately in situations that are getting more tense. IoMT deploys many sensors across a range of domains. \nFor the purpose of gathering, analysing, and disseminating data, advanced military forces have invested in communications, control, computers, command, surveillance, intelligence, and reconnaissance systems and infrastructure. Situational awareness is provided through communications, control, computers, command, surveillance, intelligence, and reconnaissance systems, while command and control systems enable those connected to interact and exchange information. IoMT strives to integrate all of this data into a unified ecosystem. \nAdditionally, from the standpoint of the defence business, assaults on secure IoT applications are riskier than attacks on regular information. The security of IoT applications safeguards the company's reputation and the confidence of its clients in the defence sector. From the standpoint of the defence sector, any security lapse in IoT applications might result in a significant loss of both revenue and client confidence. Compared to threats to confidentiality, integrity, and availability, this type of threat is more dangerous for organisations. The security of IoT applications in the defence sector is even more important when multiple security attacks often get new and unknown information or when the data is used by an attacker in different types of attacks. The problems with IoT application security, on the other hand, are big and important. \nThe most valuable and significant things in the contemporary digital world are secure IoT applications. Additionally, from the standpoint of the defence business, assaults on secure IoT applications are riskier than attacks on regular information. The security of IoT applications in the defence sector preserves the organization's reputation and the confidence of its clients. However, there are significant and serious difficulties related to IoT application security vulnerabilities. With a strong focus on the active participation of early-career researchers, Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI) is known as the best place in India for current and future leaders and innovators in the defence industry to meet and talk about the latest developments in connecting people to information. \nIn this row, we invite energetic researchers, experts, and scientists to participate in the symposium entitled \"Sustainable Internet of Things (IoT) Applications for Building an Advanced Defence Industry in India: Scope, Analysis, Challenges, and Recommendations\" (Defence_Symposium_ASCI_2022: https://easychair.org/cfp/DefenseSymposiumASCI-2022). \nBased on the Indian defence industry, this symposium is a high-quality international event that includes both academics and business people. It aims to foster communication and knowledge transfer between researchers and practitioners by promoting the use of sustainable IoT applications for building an advanced defence industry and by raising public awareness of them. This symposium is important because there is very little talk about how to keep secure IoT applications in a defence organisation from being hacked by using different security techniques. As a result, the symposium will significantly improve the security and administration of IoT applications used in defence sectors. \nThis symposium's focused approach is its key selling point. Specifically, the symposium will cover the requirements and significance of security and privacy for IoT applications in the defence industry, as well as present problems and challenges, gaps in current methods, and suggestions for future studies. Additionally, it is crucial to secure IoT applications during the decision-making process. So that IoT applications are secure and last a long time, this conference will focus on all the basic, hybrid, and new ways to make decisions based on a number of factors.

{"title": "Trade margin tweak spooks pharma", "date": "29 Sep 2022 6:40 PM GMT ", "description": "To ensure access to quality healthcare at an affordable price, the Central government is all set to rationalise trade margins on non-scheduled medicines soon. The pharmaceutical industry associations and the government agencies have come together to discuss the trade margin rationalisation (TMR) at length to reach a consensus on the issue which has been pending for quite some time now.\nFor the last couple of months, the Department of Pharmaceuticals (DoP) has convened several meetings to find an amicable solution to the issue which will have a direct bearing on the more than Rs 1,68,000 crore domestic pharmaceutical market as the present arrangement has been going on for decades together. That the government attaches upmost importance to the issue is clear from the fact that the meetings were spearheaded by none other than the Union minister for Chemicals & Fertilizers Mansukh Mandaviya himself along with DoP secretary S Aparna, National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) chairman Kamlesh Pant and other senior NPPA officials. \nThe DoP had earlier forwarded a slew of measures to rationalise the trade margins on medicines to Niti Aayog, the central government's policy think-tank. One of the measures was to reduce trade margins to 43 per cent on non-scheduled medicines. Another measure was to cap trade margin on all formulations and dosages at 100 per cent. The department had further suggested that drugs priced Rs. 2-5 a unit should be exempted from trade margin rationalisation. \nWhile the industry as a whole has come to terms with the government's move to introduce TMR, the pharma micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) have expressed reservations on the issue. They argue that if trade margins of MSMEs are capped on the basis of ex-factory price, then none of the channel partners of MSMEs will be left with any margin to promote the product and medicines from MSMEs will cease to become attractive. Not only will over 8000 pharma MSMEs close down but channel partners will go out of business too, resulting in several lakh people losing their livelihood and jobs without any gain to the consumers. \nIt is true that frequent changes in pharma policies with restrictions and new guidelines being unveiled by the government after replacing the existing ones are putting disruptions on the operations of the MSME pharma units. The MSME pharma units in the country have suggested that a practical way would be to reduce the price of the lead brands and the MSMEs can fall in line by not crossing the price of the lead brand. In a recent letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the MSMEs have stated that if trade margins are capped, the MSMEs will have no choice but to close down and in such a scenario, the consumers will gain nothing because they will be forced to buy MNC products on which capping has no effect. \nBy changing the current trade margin structure that has been in force for many decades, the government wanted to make all the drugs affordable to the consumers, especially drugs for ailments like chronic kidney disease, some high end antibiotics, anti-virals (anti-infectives), as well as some cancer drugs. The government is keen to introduce trade margin capping on pharmaceutical industry to curb the overcharging of the prices of medicines. With over 50,000 stockists and 800,000 retailers, the TMR issue is surely a complex one. \nSo, it should be implemented in a phased manner so as not to cause any disruption in the market. The date for the commencement of TMR should be conveyed at least 3 months in advance. A proper amendment should be made in the DPCO-2013 to include TMR. TMR should be applied only to non-scheduled formulations and should exclude medicines under Para 19 of DPCO-2013. For easy implementation, TMR should not be applicable to formulations with prices below Rs 100. TMR should exclude formulations for government institutional business. There are several aspects involved in the TMR issue. So, the government should come to a conclusion after taking into consideration all the concerns expressed by all the stakeholders. \n(The author is freelance journalist with varied experience \nin different fields) ", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/opinion/news-analysis/trade-margin-tweak-spooks-pharma-763669"},
{"title": "Sustaining Ecotourism In India \u2013 The Way Forward", "date": "25 Sep 2022 7:08 PM GMT ", "description": "'Rethinking Tourism' is the theme adopted by United Nations' World Tourism Organization (WTO)for this year'sWorld Tourism Day, September 27, in order to lay thruston meeting the challenges of sustainability and climate change. Ecotourism, obviously finds a rightful place in this context in view of its inherent attribute of striking a perfect balance between environment and sustainable development.\nInternational Ecotourism Society, 1993, defines ecotourism as responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment and improves the well-being of local people.Ecotourism, therefore, with its four distinctive characteristics \u2013 responsible travel, exposure to nature, conservation of environment and local people's welfare \u2013stands apart from other forms of tourism. \nForests in our country with rich biodiversity (12% of plant and 7% of animal species of the world), varied geographic features, wide-ranging forest types, a good number of natural heritage sites, incredible cultural heritage andlargesttribal population offer tremendous potential for ecotourism development in the country. \n \nThough the term, ecotourism, is of recent origin from 1980s, the visit and travel to forests and wilderness areas by the people is not new to our country. Communities protecting and visiting a few forest patches as abodes of their culture (sacred groves) is a practice existing since time immemorial. A few traditionalpractices such as Jataras, KartikaVanasamradhana and others associated with the visit to forests and natural areas have been in vogue for centuries. Recreation forestry of Europe and America in 1950s and ecotourism in different parts of the world in 1980s gave birth to the organised forest and wildlife-based tourism. The initiatives of Jungle Lodges in Karnataka and Wildlife tourism in Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala were some of the early examples of such kind in our country. The success story of community-based ecotourism at Tekkady wildlife sanctuary started in 1990s in Kerala where former hunters turned into protectors of forestsbecame an inspiration to start such initiatives in other parts of the country. Today, community-based ecotourism with its wide spread coverage is a fast-growing sector in our country. \n \nEcotourismis increasingly realised as a powerful tool for conservation, a sustainablesource of non-extractive benefits to the local communities and a facility to serve the people (visitors). In order to provide an impetus to the development of ecotourism, the Ministry of Tourism, Government of India, has brought out a document of National Strategy for Ecotourism on April 29 this year. The strategy identifies seven strategic pillars namely state assessment and ranking, state strategy for ecotourism, capacity building and certification, marketing and promotion, destination and product development, public private partnerships and government and institutional frame work to promote development and growth of ecotourism in the country. \nThe paper also refers to the roles of central and state governments, panchayat raj institutions, industry, non-governmental organisations and local community and the importance of inter sectoral coordination and convergence to create synergies for development of ecotourism.It is a very comprehensive document prepared with rich professional inputs from tourism sector. \nOne of the operating procedures stipulated in the strategy is to give ecotourism blocks delineated from forest to private sector operators with long term agreements for managing ecotourism. This isnot only a major digression from the existing policy and legal framework pertaining to forest and environment but also inconsistent with the basic underlined theme of ecotourism. Detailed deliberations with wide cross section of stakeholders, therefore,become necessary on this subject before it finds application in the field. \n \nIn forest areas natural features/attractions form theecotourism resources which need no investment for creation. But finances are required to take up site-specific, appropriate, cost-effective, eco-friendly interventionssuch as trekking/hiking paths, safari routes, rain shelters, seasonal tented camping facilities, tree platforms/machans etc., to facilitate the tourism activities. The policy and legal provisions also prescribe minimal works with little or no impact on environmentinside the forests which require limited expenditure. \nTherefore, the proposal to involveprivate sectorfor the sake of mobilising investments finds no rationale. In general, long-term agreements are contemplated to give time to recover the huge investments made by the operators. But it is not the case with ecotourism works in the forests where huge expenditure is not involved. Further, the principle of 'economy of scale' finds exception when the objective is to strike a balance between conservation and community wellbeing. The larger the size ofan activity, the more would be the exploitation/usage of resources by disregarding the carrying capacity limits. The optimum size of an ecotourism activity will work towards effective conservation and community welfare on sustainable basis. Therefore, associating private sector on the grounds of its advantageous position to manage large-scale operations makes no strong contention. \nWith extensiveand highest rate of dependence on the forest(about 400 million people are dependent on forest, TERI, 2015)and with one of the lowest per capita forest areas(0.06 Ha) in the world, it becomes necessary to promote ecotourism as socio-economic activity rather than commercial venture in our country. Private sector is proved to be efficient and competent to successfully run commercial ventures but not socio economic activities. Moreover, the experience of ecotourism projects taken up on Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode in Himachal Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh (combined state) through the concerned state forest corporations in the past which met with big failure and negative consequences suggest that private participation is not suitable for ecotourism promotion. Hence the proposition of handing over ecotourism blocks delineated from forest to private sector operators with long term agreementsis not justifiable. \nLocal communities, on the other hand, have better strengths in guiding and organising the ecotourism activities of trekking, nature walks, rock climbing, jungle safari, bird watching, wild animals sighting, botanisation, wildlife photography, boating, rafting etc., and to provide unique experience as compared to private operator who is stranger to the forest and locality. \nCommunity management has also edge due to the reasons of efficiency, cost effectiveness, cultural affinity, low impact creation and socio economic orientation. Since ecotourism areas are ecologically sensitive and communities associated are of vulnerable groups, active participation of communities becomes all the more important. There are several success stories of community based ecotourism enterprises showing positive results on improvement of livelihoods/economic prosperity of local peopleand quality upgradation of forests recorded in our country and other parts of Asia, Africa and Latin America. \n \nEcotourism should be seen as an integral part of forestry and not as a mere segment of tourism in view of its special characteristics, need for sustainable management and its impact on forest and community livelihoods. Promoting community-based, small scale ecotourism activities with good networking as opposed to large-scale ecotourism enterprises under a private or corporate management will aid in development and growth of sustainable and true ecotourism. \nHowever, the support of private sector in marketing and hospitality (outside the forest) can be taken to complement the efforts of communities depending on the need. Empowering the communities through skill upgradation, capacity building, entrepreneurship development besides placing appropriate institutional mechanism to manage the ecotourism activities in each of the states is the need of the hour. \nInstitutional arrangements in the form of autonomous bodies such as state ecotourism development boards, foundations, ecotourism corporations with coordinating role to forest service can pave the way for effective management and growth of the community based ecotourism activities. The state governments should take lead in creating enabling environment to promote community based ecotourism through appropriate policy and legislative measures in order tomaximize the benefit of both forest improvement and community prosperity.

{"title": "India's ace diplomacy at Samarkand", "date": "22 Sep 2022 10:45 PM GMT ", "description": "During the last fortnight, India has asserted itself diplomatically by refusing to join an important pillar of the US-led IPEF (Indo-Pacific Economic Frame), and at the same time Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Samarkand has demonstrated his government's resolve to act globally and resolutely in interactions with regional leaders. \nThe 22nd summit of the eight-nation Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) took place in Uzbekistan's capital Samarkand, last week. The summit was held amid the growing geo-political turmoil set-off by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and China's aggressive military posturing in the Taiwan Straits. \nChina which initiated this regional grouping as Shanghai Five in 1996, has transformed the forum into an influential grouping of eight nations, with many more like Iran to join as a permanent member and diverse countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, Belarus and Mongolia being given Observer status, which shows its transformation into an influential regional forum, besides challenging to other western regional alliances. \nIn his address at the summit, Modi obdurately touched every relevant aspect of the current geo-political situation. He urged SCO to strive to develop reliable, resilient and diversified supply chains in the region. For this, better connectivity will be required, besides giving full rights of transit to each other, he asserted, in a veiled reference to Pakistan. He also batted for making India a regional manufacturing hub. On tackling the challenges of food security, he spoke of India's efforts to popularise millets as an alternative and cheap option. \nIn a speech that was otherwise free from references to India's regional issues on terrorism with Pakistan and on territorial sovereignty with China, Modi called for greater cooperation in the Eurasian region. He also focused on initiatives on manufacturing that India is willing to pilot in the next year, when India assumes the chair of the SCO and hosts the Summit in mid-2023. \n \nThe most important meeting from India's standpoint was a possible meeting between Prime Minister Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Everyone wondered whether roadblocks have been cleared and temperaments cooled after the recent success of commander level talks between two countries on the issues of Chinese aggression in the Ladakh region in May 2020. \nBut, officially the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) mentioned no such meetings. In fact, Samarkand offered the perfect opportunity for two leaders to reset the ties. But there seemed little willingness from the two sides, to compromise. In fact, if the reports are to be believed, the exchange between the two leaders, reminded one of the cold treatment meted out by Modi to former Pakistan's Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, at the 2014 SAARC summit, though it eventually ended with a handshake at the last moment, but nothing such happened in Samarkand. But the moot question here is whether China is in a mood to mend ties with India? \nWell, it seems no, not at the moment perhaps. Modi and Xi have met twice earlier but that is not enough to read each other's thoughts and also make a convincing and principled case, though both the countries stand to gain much economically, if ties are improved. Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra, when asked about a meeting that never happened said that he did not \"think there is anything more to read into that\". \n \nModi's bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the summit also received a lot of attention. The two leaders shared the customary diplomatic greetings, with Modi specifically emphasising that the modern era was not a time of war. According to reports, Putin acknowledged India's position on the Ukrainian conflict and reaffirmed his commitment to a speedy resolution. \nIndia and Chinese leaders expressing their concerns directly with the Russian leader about the war in Ukraine is reflective of global concerns about the effects of its aggression, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last weel. \nThe mainstream American media praised Prime Minister Modi for telling Putin that this is \"not the time for war\" in Ukraine. It was the lead story on the webpages of both The Washington Post and The New York Times, and was widely carried by the mainstream American media. \nAmong other impromptu meetings was the one important one between Modi and Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, which was held unannounced on September 16. After the meeting, Modi underlined that the focus was on economic ties between the two countries. \nThe MEA, in a statement, described the meeting as a review of current India-Turkey relations. While noting the increase in recent years in economic relations, particularly bilateral trade, it acknowledged the potential for further enhancement of economic and commercial partnerships. Erdogan last visited India in 2017. \nWhile India-Turkey's economic and commercial cooperation constitutes an important dimension of the bilateral relationship, diplomatic ties have been adversely impacted over Turkiye's public criticism of the revocation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and the February 2020 riots in north-east Delhi. \n \nAnother important meeting at Samarkand was between Modi and Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi. Both the leaders took the opportunity to discuss boosting ties in areas like energy, commerce and connectivity. They also reviewed progress of the Shahid Behesti terminal at Chabahar Port and there are indications that the Iranian president also discussed a new mechanism to supply crude oil to India on rupee payment basis, instead of American dollars. This may bring the two countries closer on the trade and economic fronts. \nThe manner in which Modi and his diplomatic team carried the business at Samarkand shows the maturity and coming of age of the Indian diplomacy under the Prime Minister. \nIndia will be hosting the next SCO Summit in 2023, and this will offer Modi an opportunity to develop the organisation into a more meaningful and cohesive organisation. A fact evident by the number of countries, which are desirous of joining it, due to its regional potential.

{"title": "A humane judgement", "date": "1 Oct 2022 10:29 PM GMT ", "description": "It is indeed an historical judgement by the Supreme Court that single women with pregnancies between 20 weeks to 24 weeks are entitled to access the same safe and legal abortion care as married women. I feel this great judgement for single women with pregnancy up to 24 weeks is a divine gift during holy Devi Navarathri festival days. As said in the judgement, artificial distinction between married and unmarried women is unconstitutional taking away freedom and rights of single women whether to carry pregnancy or abort. \nIt is alarming that nearly 67% of abortions carried in single women between 2007-2011 were classified as unsafe. As MTP Act 1971 did not allow single women for abortions, unless any threat to life, many qualified doctors refused abortions for legal issues and this has resulted in many single women with pregnancy approach quacks for abortion who charge heavily and perform abortions in unhealthy atmosphere resulting in complications of heavy bleeding, infection and some deaths too. In spite of police booking cases on quacks, many women till the date continue to approach the quacks and land in trouble just to get aborted to avoid bad name in the family and society. \nAs Supreme Court permitted abortion to single women on a par with married women, all qualified doctors now can take up all abortion cases up to 24 weeks without any fear and do justice to single women for safe abortions in all hospitals by qualified doctors. Another vital point in the judgement is Registered Medical Practitioner need not disclose the identity and other personal details of minor for abortion to police under Section 19(1) of POCSO Act. Great judgement with human and women touch. \n \nII \nThe routine use of ultrasound and other machines in pregnancy management has allowed the diagnosis of many conditions in the foetus. The legal age for termination from 20 to 24 has certainly eased the pressure on medical practitioners dealing with many foetal anomalies where the window of 20 weeks was just too narrow for anybody's comfort. In the west, political ideologies, religious affiliations, and socio-cultural factors (50% unwed mothers in the USA) all play a role in vigorous debates on terminations. \nThe whole range of ethical, moral, social, and legal issues is presently complex and confusing. Two lives entangle as one unit and a clash sets up between the autonomy of a vociferous mother and the silence of the dependent foetus. Unfortunately, the idea and essence of motherhood disappears in the discourse even as foetal rights make the entry. At the crux of western debates is the consideration of when life does begin. At conception, birth, or at some point in between? \nSome scholars interestingly propose a 24 weeks limit based on some research showing well-formed foetal brain waves 'typical' of humans declaring the transition of a fetus to a human. The Supreme Court seems to have come to that figure circuitously as the primary consideration was the safety of the mother while carrying the terminations. This is not the final word of course since the ethical and legal issues are going to only increase in the future as more diseases enter the domain of pre-delivery diagnosis, more newborns survive earlier stages of gestation, unwanted conceptions increase, and marriage becomes more disdainful. \n- Dr Pingali Gopal, Hanamkonda", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/opinion/news-analysis/a-humane-judgement-763903"},
{"title": "Has pandemic changed our personalities?", "date": "3 Oct 2022 1:19 AM GMT ", "description": "For many of us, some personality traits stay the same throughout our lives while others change only gradually. However, evidence shows that significant events in our personal lives which induce severe stress or trauma can be associated with more rapid changes in our personalities.\nA new study, published in PLOS ONE, suggests the Covid pandemic has indeed triggered much greater shifts in personality than we would expect to have seen naturally over this period. In particular, the researchers found that people were less extroverted, less open, less agreeable and less conscientious in 2021 and 2022 compared with before the pandemic. This study included more than 7,000 participants from the US, aged between 18 and 109, who were assessed before the pandemic (from 2014 onwards), early in the pandemic in 2020, and then later in the pandemic in 2021 or 2022. \nAt each time point, participants completed the \"Big Five Inventory.\" This assessment tool measures personality on a scale across five dimensions: extroversion versus introversion, agreeableness versus antagonism, conscientiousness versus lack of direction, neuroticism versus emotional stability, and openness versus closedness to experience. There were not many changes between pre-pandemic and 2020 personality traits. \nHowever, the researchers found significant declines in extroversion, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness in 2021/2022 compared with before the pandemic. These changes were akin to a decade of normal variation, suggesting the trauma of the COVID pandemic had accelerated the natural process of personality change. Interestingly, younger adults' personalities changed the most in the study. They showed marked declines in agreeableness and conscientiousness, and a significant increase in neuroticism in 2021/2022 compared with pre-pandemic. This may be due in part to social anxiety when emerging back into society, having missed out on two years of normality. \nMany of us became more health-conscious during the pandemic, for example by eating better and doing more exercise. A lot of us sought whatever social connections we could find virtually, and tried to refocus our attention on psychological, emotional and intellectual growth \u2013 for example, by practising mindfulness or picking up new hobbies. Nonetheless, mental health and wellbeing decreased significantly. This makes sense given the drastic changes we went through. \nNotably, personality significantly impacts our wellbeing. For example, people who report high levels of conscientiousness, agreeableness or extroversion are more likely to experience the highest level of wellbeing. So the personality changes detected in this study may go some way to explaining the decrease in wellbeing we've seen during the pandemic. \nIf we look more closely, the pandemic appears to have negatively affected the following areas: -- our ability to express sympathy and kindness towards others (agreeableness); -- our capacity to be open to new concepts and willing to engage in novel situations (openness); -- our tendency to seek out and enjoy other people's company (extraversion); -- our desire to strive towards our goals, do tasks well or take responsibilities towards others seriously (conscientiousness). All of these traits influence our interaction with the environment around us, and as such, may have played a role in our wellbeing decline. For example, working from home may have left us feeling demotivated and as though our career was going nowhere (lower conscientiousness). \nThis in turn may have affected our wellbeing by making us feel more irritable, depressed or anxious. \nWhat next? Over time, our personalities usually change in a way that helps us adapt to ageing and cope more effectively with life events. In other words, we learn from our life experiences and this subsequently impacts our personality. As we age, we generally see increases in self-confidence, self-control and emotional stability. However, participants in this study recorded changes in the opposite direction to the usual trajectory of personality change. This is understandable given that we faced an extended period of difficulties, including constraints on our freedoms, lost income and illness. All these experiences have evidently changed us \u2013 and our personalities. This study provides us with some very useful insights into the impacts of the pandemic on our psyche. \nThese impacts may subsequently influence many aspects of our lives, such as wellbeing.

{"title": "Banning extremist bodies a right step", "date": "30 Sep 2022 7:33 PM GMT ", "description": "In a decisive move, a communal and radical outfit, Popular Front of India (PFI), has been banned for five years by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) for its alleged links to terror funding. In addition to this, PFI's associate organisations \u2013 Rehab India Foundation (RIF), Campus Front of India (CFI), All India Imams Council (AIIC), National Confederation of Human Rights Organization (NCHRO), National Women's Front, Junior Front, Empower India Foundation and Rehab Foundation, Kerala \u2013 are also banned leading to debate in the media about this.\nA leading organisation of Pasmanda Muslims named All India Pasmanda Muslim Mahaz has welcomed this move stating that the Pasmanda Mahaz is against Muslim communalism and believes that such organisations are also against the basic spirit of Islam. So, the extremist and radical organisations must be proscribed in order to maintain peace and harmony in the country, especially those organisations which have been instituted in the name of Islam but fail to follow Islamic principles and teachings. Islam propagates love and compassion for building an idealistic society devoid of fundamentalist organisations and proprietors who incite evil and violent activities. \nThere is a famous 'hadees,' which states: \"Whosoever of you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand; and if he is not able to do so, then with his tongue; and if he is not able to do so, then with his heart and that is the weakest of faith.\" This hadees motivates all Muslims to prevent the wrong doer whether it includes big sins like killing, lynching, mass violence or small sins as abusing, backbiting. \nA true Muslim must stop wicked person and organisation. \nSuch organisations must be banned which encourages a sense of enmity rather than love and compassion; provoking innocent Muslims into violent protests rather than focusing on a peaceful, prosperous community. The Prophet Muhammad never allowed his companions to create instability and dissonance. \n\"Whoever wrongs one with whom a covenant has been made, burdens him with more than he can bear or forcibly takes something from him, I will be his adversary on the Day of Judgment,\" (Al-Baihaqi). \nThe Indian Muslim community has been enjoying liberty of religion, equality, for earning livelihood, fraternity for prosperous society and enjoying a peaceful lifestyle. \nIslam is as old in India as it is in Mecca. The great examples of the Barwada Mosque in Ghogha, Gujarat built before 623 CE, Cheraman Juma Mosque (629 CE) in Methala, Kerala and Palaiya Jumma Palli (or The Old Jumma Masjid - 628 - 630 CE) in Kilakarai testify to the statement. \nAll these mosques could not have survived if there was hatred and communal tensions between the communities in the past. This shows that Muslims have always enjoyed peaceful and friendly relations with their other Indian counterparts who have different faiths. \nConsequently, if a handful of deviated Muslims form such organisations or institutions that stand against love, peace, brotherhood and Indian Constitution, they must be banned and boycotted immediately. \n\"None of you (truly) believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself.\" (Hadees). The reliable and applicable Hadees shows the importance of good will for our neighbours and near ones. Contrasting this Hadees, proprietors and partners of radical organisations like Popular Front of India (PFI) have been trying to snare innocent unemployed Muslims in the organisation and grooming them to develop radical violent approaches and to harass innocent people not conforming to their ideology. \nThese organisations are working against humanity. The nationwide ban is expected to force them to quit their unethical work and repent to their flaws; adopt a simple and straightforward path that will lead them to build a prosperous culture and tradition as the following Quranic verse pleads unambiguously. \"Except for those who repent, believe and do righteous work. For them Allah will replace their evil deeds with good. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful. (Quran 25:70)\" \n(Dr Fyzie is an author, translator, socio-pasmanda activist and medical doctor by profession)", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/opinion/news-analysis/banning-extremist-bodies-a-right-step-763828"},
{"title": "The frog, the scorpion and Pakistan", "date": "28 Sep 2022 7:13 PM GMT ", "description": "PAKISTAN Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was in New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly's (UNGA) 77th session. On September 23 he addressed the UNGA. Talking to Pakistan media in New York ahead of the meet, Sharif said that his aim would be to make the world community aware of the devastation that monsoon rain has caused in his country, one-third of which remains submerged under floodwater. \nThe devastation caused by the recent floods in Pakistan is no doubt catastrophic. Nearly 40 million have become homeless, thousands of kilometres of roads and scores of bridges have swept away, millions of rupees' worth of livestock is dead, crops have gone and thousands are suffering from diseases such as dengue, dysentery, cholera, malaria and typhoid. \nBut the Pakistani Prime Minister mentioned to the press something that was totally out of context. He said that the 'Kashmir issue' would also be mentioned during his address to the UNGA. \nAnd he did, raising the Kashmir issue and also painting his country as a victim of terrorism. \nThis reminds one of a story in which a scorpion approaches a frog and asks it to carry him on its back across the river. The frog hesitates and tells the scorpion that he does not trust it since he might sting the frog. The scorpion begs the frog to take him across and promises that he will cause no harm to the frog. As the frog carries the scorpion on its back, gets to the middle of the river, the scorpion stings the frog releasing his poison in under the skin of the frog. \nThe frog asks the scorpion why did it sting him despite promising that the scorpion would not sting him. To this the scorpion said apologetically, \"I just couldn't help it, you see to sting is my nature.\" \nPakistan shares the same nature. No matter how many times one trusts Pakistan it always stings it benefactor. At the time of partition of Indian sub-continent in August 1947, Pakistan had signed a stand-still agreement with the Maharaja of the state of Jammu and Kashmir promising to accept the sovereignty of the state. Yet on October 22, 1947, Pakistan attacked the state of Jammu and Kashmir! In 1999 when Nawaz Sharif was Pakistan's Prime Minister and was expressing his profound desire to trade with India, his Army Chief attacked our territory in Kargil. \nPakistan was created in the name of religion and communal division \u2013 something that it nurtures even to this day. In order to remain relevant, the Pakistan military establishment has to keep the threat of an Indian attack and an imaginary suppression of Muslims in Kashmir and wider India alive. \nShehbaz Sharif's coalition government that has been allegedly propped up by the anti-Imran Khan section of the Pakistan military establishment led by its chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, is only dedicatedly following the official foreign policy line designed for nearly seven decades by the Pakistan military establishment. \nOn September 29, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman, Imran Khan is due to address a public rally in Muzaffarabad, the capital city of Pakistan-Occupied-Jammu Kashmir. He will very subtly be portraying India as a hurdle in achieving regional peace by using the Kashmir card and will use the Islamic communal hate card to garner support and prove himself to be a great Islamic warrior who could turn Pakistan into a great fort of Islam, thus laying the ground for future generation to carry the Ghazwa-e-Hind across the India sub-continent. \nOn September 23, the Pakistani Prime Minister asked for the Kashmir issue to be resolved and continently forgetting that it was Pakistan and not India which remains the root cause of the break-up of the state of Jammu and Kashmir and must withdraw its military from Pakistan-occupied Jammu Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan. \nTo talk about Kashmir at a forum extended to Pakistan by the world community to make an appeal to help it with the cost of the damages caused by flood is akin to the story of the frog and the scorpion. To mention anti-Indian communal hate narrative in the backdrop of Kashmir is in Pakistan's nature.

{"title": "Dust the monsoon dirt off your feet", "date": "4 Oct 2022 6:41 PM GMT ", "description": "Foot hygiene is essential throughout the year, however, it is all the more crucial during monsoon. Taking care of feet during the rainy season can be quite tricky as they're exposed to dirt, germs, and disease more than any other body part due to prolonged and constant exposure to standing water and rainwater during a downpour. \nThe rain, wetness and humidity in the air can cause smelly feet, sweaty feet, wet shoes, fungal infections, cracked toes, athlete foot, fungal infections and many other allergies. \nThe main problem during the Monsoons is high humidity and sweat. The feet are among the areas where germs accumulate and odour forms. The waste matter, which is secreted with sweat, has to be removed by daily washing, to eliminate odour and feel fresh and clean. \nMake sure you wash your feet every time when you return home with gentle warm water and mild soap daily to keep infections at bay. . Dry the area between your toes and apply an anti-fungal powder daily. \nPay special attention to your feet, while bathing. After washing them well, dry them thoroughly and apply talcum powder. Keep your feet dry and avoid wearing wet shoes. Several bacteria breeds in humidity and wearing closed shoes makes it the perfect environment for pesky fungal infections during monsoon season. \nIf you wear closed shoes, talcum powder can be sprinkled inside the shoes. However, in the hot season avoid high heels and covered footwear as slippers and open sandals are best because they allow maximum ventilation and help the perspiration evaporate quickly and make your feet dry. But, open footwear also attracts dirt and therefore, foot hygiene becomes all the more important. After a hot day, soak your feet in cold water, to which some salt has been added. \n A foot problem called \"Athlete's Foot\" develops more easily during hot and humid weather, because it thrives on soggy skin. If neglected, it can become a stubborn problem, with an itchy condition. The athlete's foot starts with a fungus infection. So, if there is dry scaling on the feet, especially between the toes, with some itching, consult a dermatologist without delay. Anti-fungal preparations are effective in dealing with the problem in the initial stages. However, excessive moisture, caused by excessive sweating, tight shoes and humid weather can lead to bacterial activity and this worsens the condition. Avoid socks and wear open shoes, use talcum powder and keep the feet as dry as possible. If socks are a must, wear cotton ones. In fact, during the hot and humid season, the feet should be exposed to the air as much as possible. Regularly cut short your foot nails during the monsoon to prevent the dust and dirt from getting collected under your nails to check for fungal infections. \nUse a foot scrubber and then apply a good moisturizer that works effectively on hard skin and helps keep the heels soft and smooth. \nIn one-fourth bucket of warm water, add half a cup of coarse salt and 10 drops of lemon, or orange essential oil (if you cannot get essential oil, use a half cup of lemon or orangve juice). If your feet tend to sweat a lot, use a few drops of tea tree oil, as it has germicidal properties. It helps to deal with bad odour. Soak the feet for 10 to 15 minutes. \nMix together 3 tablespoons of rose water, 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and one teaspoon of pure glycerin. Apply on your feet and leave on for half an hour. \nIn one-fourth bucket of cold water, put 2 tablespoons honey, one tablespoon herbal shampoo, and one tablespoon of almond oil. Soak feet in it for 20 minutes. \nAdd rose water, lemon juice and a splash of eau de cologne in cold water and soak feet in it. Cools cleans and removes the odour. \nTake 100 ml olive oil and add 2 DROPS eucalyptus oil, 2 DROPS rosemary oil and 3 DROPS khus, or rose oil. Mix together and keep in an airtight glass jar. Use a little of this for foot massage. It cools and protects the skin and keeps it healthy.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/life-style/dust-the-monsoon-dirt-off-your-feet-764241"},

{"title": "Need for closer Indo-Japanese ties", "date": "20 Sep 2022 6:40 PM GMT ", "description": "There is consensus on both sides that a strong India-Japan relationship is very important for a free, open, rule-based and inclusive Indo-Pacific based upon sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations. India's Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI) shares many commonalities with Japan's Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP). India has also developed maritime cooperation with regional partners in consonance with our inclusive vision of Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR).\nJapan and India, along with Australia and the United States, are members of the Quad group of countries that hold annual naval exercises across the Indo-Pacific region to demonstrate interoperability. Both India and Japan are members of Quad, G20 and G-4. They are also member countries of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). \nIndia, like Japan, is bolstering its military to tackle what it sees as increased security threats. Both countries are increasingly wary of China's growing military might and assertiveness. China claims almost all the energy-rich waters of the South China Sea, where it has established military outposts on artificial islands. In the East China Sea, China claims a group of uninhabited Japanese-administered islets. \nIndia, which last week commissioned its first home-built aircraft carrier, is involved in a standoff with Chinese forces on their remote Himalayan border. The last meeting of Quad leaders, in May in Japan, was dominated by discussion about Taiwan after US President Joe Biden angered China by saying he would be willing to use force to defend the democratic island. As they met, Russian and Chinese warplanes conducted a joint patrol in the region. \nThe participation of Japan for the first time in the multilateral exercise MILAN and the operationalization of the Reciprocal Provision of Supply and Services Agreement in March this year are milestones in the progress of defence cooperation between our Forces. We are happy to note that our Air Forces are working closely on the early conduct of the inaugural Air Force fighter exercise, says Rajnath Singh, Defence Minister. \nHe adds, enhancing the defence equipment and technological cooperation between India and Japan is one of our key priority areas. In our meeting today, I had the opportunity to propose engagements in emerging and critical technological domains. I have also invited the Japanese defence companies to look at opportunities in investing in the Indian defence corridors. \nIndia and Japan defence forces organize a series of bilateral exercises namely, JIMEX (naval), SHINYUU Maitri (Air Force), and Dharma Guardian (Army). Both countries also participate in Malabar exercise (Naval Exercise) with the USA and Australia. \nJIMEX 22 involves two Phases; exercises at sea and a harbour phase at Visakhapatnam. This edition marks the 10th anniversary of JIMEX, which began in Japan in 2012. It also coincides with the 70th anniversary of establishing of diplomatic relations between India and Japan. JIMEX 22 seeks to consolidate the high degree of interoperability that exists between maritime forces of the two countries, through complex exercises in the surface, sub-surface and air domains. \nBoth sides should also work jointly towards implementing their decision to have 5 trillion yen in public and private investment and financing from Japan to India in the next five years. \nIndia highlighted the steps taken by it to improve ease of doing business, logistics through the 'Gati Shakti' initiative and urged Japan to support greater investments by Japanese companies in India. Such investments would help in creating resilient supply chains and would be mutually beneficial. \nIndia appreciated that Japanese companies are increasing their investments in India and that 24 Japanese companies had successfully applied under the various Production Linked Incentive schemes. Both Countries noted the progress in implementation of Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail project and welcomed the signing of exchange of notes of the 3rd tranche of loan for this project. \nBoth the countries have agreed to encourage greater collaboration between private sectors of both sides in the development of next generation communication technologies. They also agreed to deepen cooperation in the area of Clean Energy including green hydrogen. They took note of the progress in implementation of the Specified Skilled Workers (SSW) programme and agreed to further scale up this programme, boosting people to people linkages. \nMore collaboration and cooperation can prove beneficial to both nations, since India needs sophisticated technology from Japan. There is a huge potential with respect to Make in India. Joint ventures could be created by merging Japanese digital technology with Indian raw materials and labour. Close cooperation is the best measure to combat China's growing role in Asia and Indo-Pacific, in physical as well as digital space.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/opinion/news-analysis/need-for-closer-indo-japanese-ties-762478"},

{"title": "IISc team develops algorithm to detect seizures", "date": "2 Oct 2022 10:30 AM GMT ", "description": "Researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) have joined hands with AIIMS Rishikesh to create an algorithm that can help decipher brain scans and identify the occurrence and type of epilepsy. \n \nThe development has the potential to do away with the current practice of manual evaluation of Electroencephalogram (EEG) which can be often tedious and sometimes lead to errors. \n \nEpilepsy is a neurological condition where the brain emits sudden bursts of electrical signals in a short amount of time, resulting in seizures, fits and sometimes even death. \n \nBased on the point of origin of the brain's erratic signals, epilepsy is classified as either focal or generalised epilepsy. Focal epilepsy occurs when the erratic signals are confined to a specific region in the brain. If the signals are at random locations, then it is termed as generalised epilepsy, an IISc statement said. \n \n\"The research aims to differentiate EEG of normal subjects from epileptic EEGs. Additionally, the developed algorithm attempts to identify the types of seizures. Our work is to help the neurologists make an efficient and quick automated screening and diagnosis,\" says Hardik J. Pandya, Assistant Professor at the Department of Electronic Systems Engineering (DESE) and the corresponding author of the study published in Biomedical Signal Processing and Control. \n \nDuring the course of their study, the team noted a novel algorithm that can sift through EEG data and identify signatures of epilepsy from the electrical signal patterns. \n \nAfter initial training, the algorithm was able to detect whether a human subject could have epilepsy or not -- based on these patterns in their respective analyses -- with a high degree of accuracy, the researchers say. \n \nTo develop and train the algorithm, the researchers first examined EEG data from 88 human subjects acquired at AIIMS Rishikesh. Each subject underwent a 45-minute EEG test, divided into two parts: an initial 10-minute test when the subject was awake, which included photic stimulation and hyperventilation, followed by a 35-minute sleep period when the subject was asked to sleep. Next, the team analysed this data and classified different wave patterns into sharp signals, spikes and slow waves. \n \nSpikes are patterns where a signal rises and falls within a very short duration of time (70 milliseconds), while sharps are those with rises and falls spread over a slightly longer duration (250 milliseconds) and slow waves have a much longer duration (400 milliseconds). \n \nAn epileptic subject shows a different set of patterns compared to a healthy individual. The researchers developed an algorithm to calculate the total number of sharp waves -- the Cumulative Sharp Count -- and use this as a parameter to detect if the subject is epileptic or not (a higher value indicates a greater chance that the subject is epileptic). \n \nThe algorithm also calculates the sum of areas under the spikes and sharp curves to distinguish between focal and generalised epilepsy (a greater value indicates generalised epilepsy as opposed to focal epilepsy, which has a lower value). \n \nThe researchers add that the study shows a way to identify absence seizures (those that involve a brief, sudden lapse of consciousness), using a Cumulative Spike-Wave Count; in some cases, these absence seizures are critical and can be fatal. \n \nThe team then ran their algorithm on a new set of EEG data from subjects for whom the classification (whether they had epilepsy, and if so, what type of epilepsy they had) was already known to the doctors. This blind validation study successfully classified the subjects accurately in nearly 91 per cent of the cases. \n \n\"We hope to refine this further by testing on more data to consider more variabilities of human EEGs until we reach the point where this becomes completely translational and robust,\" says Rathin K. Joshi, a PhD student in DESE and first author of the study. \n \nIISc said that a patent has been filed for the work and the algorithm is being tested for its reliability by physicians at AIIMS Rishikesh.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/life-style/iisc-team-develops-algorithm-to-detect-seizures-763969"},

The work shows for the first time this works in people as they went about normal everyday life. In a study, which holds potential for dietary management of the condition, people with type 2 diabetes drank a pre-made shot before meals which contained a low dose of whey protein. They were monitored for a week as they went about normal daily life. \n \nTo compare the potential benefits of whey protein, the same participants also spent a week drinking a control shot that contained no protein in order to measure the results against each other. Results from continuous glucose monitoring revealed that glucose levels were much better controlled when taking the whey supplement before meals. On average, they had two hours extra per day of normal blood sugar levels compared to the no protein week. In addition, their daily blood glucose levels were 0.6 mmol/L lower compared to when they consumed the supplement without any protein. \n \nDr Daniel West, Senior Lecturer and Principal Investigator working within the Human Nutrition Research Centre and Diabetes Research Group at Newcastle University, UK said: \"While previous studies for a few hours in the lab have shown the potential for this dietary intervention, this is the first time that people have been monitored as they go about normal life. \"We believe the whey protein works in two ways, firstly, by slowing down how quickly food passes through the digestive system and secondly, by stimulating a number of important hormones that prevent the blood sugars climbing so high. \n \n\"As we see growing numbers of people around the world developing diabetes, investigating the potential of alternatives to drugs such as food supplements becomes more important.\" 18 people with type 2 diabetes consumed a small drink -- in a 100 ml shot- with 15 grams of protein 10 minutes before breakfast, lunch and dinner over seven days and remained on their prescribed diabetes medication.

The Russian president announced, at a ceremony in Moscow's Red Square, that the incorporation of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, in the south and east of Ukraine, into Russia is the \"choice of millions of people\" who share a \"common history\" with the Russian Federation.\n\"We call on the Kyiv regime to immediately end hostilities, end the war that they unleashed back in 2014 and return to the negotiating table. We are ready for this,\" Putin said. \"But we will not discuss the choice of the people in Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. That has been made. Russia will not betray them.\" \nWhat the Russian president didn't make clear was exactly what these newly minted so-called Russian regions actually represent. He recognised breakaway republics in Luhansk and Donetsk in the Donbas region in February, the day before he launched the all-out invasion of Ukraine. But the \"republics\" covered only part of the oblasts \u2013 or regions \u2013 these names refer to. Currently, fierce fighting continues across all four annexed regions, including around Zaporizhzhia, the location of Europe's largest nuclear power plant. It is thought that the land grab represents about 40,000 square miles, or about 15% of Ukraine's territory. It has been reported that Russian forces had shelled a civilian convoy in Zaporizhzhia, killing 25 people. There is also heavy fighting around the key town of Lyman in the Donetsk region, where Ukrainian forces are reported to be close to encircling a large number of Russian troops. \nThe latest annexations follow the model that Russia debuted in Crimea in 2014. First, let your armed backers oversee a \"referendum.\" Given the circumstances, such an event can't be considered free or fair. Second, have unqualified and partisan regime allies from abroad sign it off as free and fair. Third, publicise your suspiciously large democratic mandate for incorporating the territories, dismiss international objections of illegality, and proceed with annexation. \nThe Putin regime has a long history of cynically using \"the law\" to justify its actions. As Mark Galeotti, who has written 24 books about Russia and its politics wrote in the Spectator recently, Putin \"is a man who would burn down your house, but would issue himself a permit to do so first.\" \nThere is some evidence that Russia is tailoring its international messaging for the global south (developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America). Since Russia's international broadcaster, RT, was banned or blocked across Europe and North America, it has reoriented its Twitter feed towards India. This reflects Russian politicians' rhetoric in recent years which has painted the country as part of a \"rising power\" collective that opposes western hegemony. Recent diplomatic efforts aimed at Iran and Putin's appearance at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation have reinforced this impression. But the idea that Russia is fighting a \"colonial\" west doesn't stand up to scrutiny. \nRussia's messaging about countering hegemony just doesn't ring true. Domestic consumption On the other hand, the annexations might be intended to revitalise a lukewarm domestic population. Russia's state media has faithfully parroted the Kremlin's line throughout the conflict, and dissenting points of view have been ruthlessly crushed. Nonetheless, Russia's biggest shows of support for the war have appeared manufactured, and Putin's mobilisation decree last week has been met with widespread public protests. Again, these public reactions have underlined Russia's colonial mindset. \nMany metropolitan, well-to-do ethnic Russians have fled overseas. It appears that ethnic minorities have been disproportionately affected by the mobilisation. It is no accident that heated confrontations between protesters and police have occurred in Russia's north Caucasus region. Ethnic groups that experience poverty and systemic discrimination in the Russian Federation are being sent, untrained and ill-equipped, as cannon fodder to the front. \nAs my previous research has shown, Russia's national identity \u2013 and that of the Soviet Union before it \u2013 has traditionally been linked to its claim to military might and heroism. Yet, Putin's war on Ukraine has made clear the inadequacies of Russia's military. There's nothing heroic about sending unwilling and unprepared young men to die in a war of choice. Russia's political elite has believed its own stories for so long that it struggles to believe that the audiences for its claims are rapidly decreasing. Catherine the Great's lover, Grigory Potemkin, is said to have impressed her with the beauty of Russia's villages by constructing 2D painted facades. Perhaps, Russia's confidence when beginning its invasion was because of such an illusory Potemkin military, overhyped by officials unwilling to admit its corruption and decline. But resistance to Russia's occupation remains, and its Potemkin referendums are unlikely to help it turn the tide. Behind the facade, Russia's hold on these illegally annexed territories is likely to be flimsy.

{"title": "Problems and challenges in the ready-to-eat food industry", "date": "1 Oct 2022 8:48 AM GMT ", "description": "Convenience foods, also popularly called ready-to-eat food, have emerged as a boon during crisis. Conceptually, ready-to-eat food is pre-cleaned, pre-cooked and packed for consumers to consume directly without any prior preparation or long hours of cooking. Interestingly, the industry has expanded exponentially over the past few years and made its way into different segments such as canned, fast, frozen, dry, instant and preserved food, among others. \nReady-to-eat food has always existed and been in high demand in the West. However, the concept took a little longer to get accepted in the Indian markets, primarily due to prejudices that ready-to-eat meals were best suited to defence people, trekkers, hikers, disaster victims, hunters, and anyone and everyone that needed food quickly and on the travel lines. But in recent years, owing to the impact of globalisation, there has been a dramatic shift in the consumption patterns of Indian consumers. The ready-to-eat food industry in India has grown significantly in recent years, mainly because of an increase in nuclear families and a rise in gross family income. \nA report by Technavio highlighted that the ready-to-eat food industry in India is likely to grow by $751.43 million from 2021 to 2026. The industry is anticipated to accelerate at a CAGR of 18.63 per cent during this period, with Y-o-Y growth predicted at 15.09 per cent [1][2][3]. In global comparison, India ranks third after China ($122.40) and Japan ($62.04), generating a revenue of $56.93 billion in 2022[4]. These figures seem promising and indicate an optimistic scenario for the industry soon. \nThe primary reasons behind their demand are the ease of use and year-round accessibility of ready-to-eat food products. What has contributed to the high growth of products in this industry is the sedentary lifestyles of millennials. Working professionals, especially, do not have sufficient time to cook meals. Thus, on-the-go meals that require little to no time and ingredients are becoming highly sought-after. Another factor contributing to the rising demand is the increasing number of working women who are no longer prioritising the task of cooking but rather focusing on building their careers. Moreover, better job prospects have led to a migration of individuals from small towns and tier-II cities to metropolitan areas, causing a high demand for ready-to-eat products. The increasing usage of technologically advanced products like microwaves and inductions has alleviated the cooking method and embraced ready-to-eat meals that support these products. \nThe sector mainly experienced significant changes with the Covid-19 pandemic, when ready-to-eat food was considered safer for consumption than restaurant food. The shift in demand was especially noticed in the first half of 2020 when people preferred cooking at home rather than dining out, which further led people to bring home ready-to-eat products that offered plenty of variety and were quick to consume. The surge in sales of ready-to-eat products can also be credited to expanding distribution channels. \nWith so much potential demand, growth and opportunities laid out for India's industry, what caused the ready-to-eat market to come to life much later than expected? Did the industry face significant challenges along the way? Let us find out. \nIt was always believed by people, especially aged consumers, that there are plenty of food preservatives in ready-to-eat products, which condenses their nutritional value. The younger generation has often been prohibited from consuming packaged ready-to-eat products, affecting overall demand and sales in India. \nThe supply chain comprises unorganised and unbranded players like raw material manufacturers, quality testing units, research and development resources, and packaging suppliers. Several such siloed systems have made the food distribution structure a complex one. Also, the most significant setback of the lack of appropriate storage facilities has caused ample food storage. However, with advancements, third-party storage facility distributors are being roped into the supply chain, which has also caused an added operational cost. \nGlobally, in India, health experts have repeatedly warned about the health hazards of ready-to-eat food products, leading to cholesterol, obesity and high blood pressure. Claims also suggest that such foods develop diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease if consumed excessively and regularly. Moreover, convenience foods' high sugar, salt, and fat concentration have deterred consumers from buying such products for the longest time. \nUntil a few years back, the ready-to-eat food industry offered limited variety and had not explored different segments that would fulfill consumers' tastes and preferences. Only recently, the market widened for ready-to-eat products, encompassing end-to-end meal options like curries, appetizers, breakfast items, soups and snacks, baked goods, meat products, and more. Catering to the consumption diversity of consumers from different regions across the country has been a difficult challenge for food companies. \nCurrently, there is no dearth of ready-to-eat food options nor the absence of sources like supermarkets, retail chains and convenience stores to access such foods. Keeping the consumer trends and demands in mind, companies have increasingly focused on specially packaged foods for all age groups -- from choosy children to office-going parents and senior citizens -- there is something for everyone. Moreover, in a country where every second person is looking to save time in the kitchen and invest it elsewhere, either to seek education, make a living or pursue hobbies, ready-to-eat foods come in handy and provide a convenient alternative. \nThis is a breakthrough in the food manufacturing industry in India and shows the great potential of being a significant contributor to the economy!", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/life-style/food/problems-and-challenges-in-the-ready-to-eat-food-industry-763864"},

You might never know for sure why you were ghosted. While more studies require to be done specifically on the ghosting phenomenon, past research has looked at different types of attachment personalities and choice of breakup strategies. It is possible that people with an avoidant type personality (those who hesitate to form or completely avoid attachments to others, often as a result of parental rejection). Who are reluctant to get very close to anyone else due to trust and dependency issues and often use indirect methods of ending relationships, are more likely to use ghosting to initiate a break-up. \nAs per one study, it suggests that people who tend to end relationships often been ghosted themselves. In that case, the ghoster knows what it feels like t have a relationship end abruptly, with no explanation, no room for discussion. Yet, they seemingly show no empathy towards the other and might or might not experience any feeling of guilt for their ghosting behaviour. \nGhosting is by no means limited to long-term romantic relationships. Informal dating relationships, friendships, even work relationships might end with a form of ghosting. For the person who does the ghosting, simply walk away from a relationship or even a potential relationship is a quick and easy way out. No drama, no hysterics, no questions asked, no need to offer answers or justify any of their behaviour, no need to deal with someone else feeling. Certainly, while the ghoster might benefit from avoiding an uncomfortable situation and any potential dram, they have nothing to improve their own conversation and relationship skills for the future.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/life-style/ghosting-explained-know-what-it-means-to-ghost-and-to-be-ghosted-764046"},

There is now a large field of research that includes quantum computers, quantum networks, and secure quantum encrypted communication,\" the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in a statement. \nOne key factor in this development is how quantum mechanics allows two or more particles to exist in what is called an entangled state. \nWhat happens to one of the particles in an entangled pair determines what happens to the other particle, even if they are far apart. \nFor a long time, the question was whether the correlation was because the particles in an entangled pair contained hidden variables, instructions that tell them which result they should give in an experiment. \nIn the 1960s, John Stewart Bell developed the mathematical inequality that is named after him. \nThis states that if there are hidden variables, the correlation between the results of a large number of measurements will never exceed a certain value. \nHowever, quantum mechanics predicts that a certain type of experiment will violate Bell's inequality, thus resulting in a stronger correlation than would otherwise be possible. \n\"Clauser developed John Bell's ideas, leading to a practical experiment. When he took the measurements, they supported quantum mechanics by clearly violating a Bell inequality. This means that quantum mechanics cannot be replaced by a theory that uses hidden variables,\" said the Academy. \nSome loopholes, however, remained after Clauser's experiment. \nAspect developed the setup, using it in a way that closed an important loophole. He was able to switch the measurement settings after an entangled pair had left its source, so the setting that existed when they were emitted could not affect the result. \nUsing refined tools and a long series of experiments, Zeilinger then started to use entangled quantum states. Among other things, his research group has demonstrated a phenomenon called quantum teleportation, which makes it possible to move a quantum state from one particle to one at a distance. \n\"It has become increasingly clear that a new kind of quantum technology is emerging. We can see that the laureates' work with entangled states is of great importance, even beyond the fundamental questions about the interpretation of quantum mechanics,\" says Anders Irback, Chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics. \nThe prize amount of 10 million Swedish kronor will be shared equally between the winners.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/life-style/trio-wins-physics-nobel-for-unravelling-quantum-science-mysteries-764203"},

{"title": "Heart attack in young", "date": "27 Sep 2022 5:05 PM GMT ", "description": "Heart attacks, cardiac arrest, and other cardiovascular diseases have long been a major public health concern, but it is only recently that an increase in cardiovascular problems among the younger population has been diagnosed and reported. However, in India, premature obstructive CAD has arisen as a major concern for patients, clinicians, legislators, and policymakers.\n Young people with coronary artery disease (CAD) are defined as having CAD before the age of 45. With changing lifestyles, the primary cause of developing CAD at a young age is the appearance of typical risk factors in the early phases of development. It is well accepted that the CAD epidemic in India is caused by a higher prevalence of known risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, family history, abnormal lipid profile, and others. Young Indians still have a poor understanding of heart diseases. However, due to recent news of high-profile artists such as actors and singers dying of heart attacks, there is a slow but steady increase in awareness of heart attacks among the young.\nFor a long time, the significance of CAD in young women was underestimated. Even in the absence of risk factors, the symptoms of CAD in women have low specificity, and there are some sex-related variations in the illness. Furthermore, because women are thought to have a very low risk of developing CAD at a young age, obstructive CAD in young women is typically neglected. Due to resting ST-T segment variations, lower ECG voltages, and perhaps hormonal variables, the treadmill test has very low sensitivity in women. Because of the increasing prevalence of atypical symptoms, the limited efficiency of non-invasive diagnostic testing, and the frequent discovery of normal/non obstructive CAD on angiography, identifying predictors of obstructive CAD in younger females prior to intrusive testing is critical. \nAdditionally, when young women are compared to similarly aged males, gender differences in post-acute coronary syndrome mortality risk are more significant. Moreover, women are considerably more prone to develop unfavourable side effects, such as bleeding problems, following reperfusion therapy. \nI was part of a small study done retrospectively at tertiary care centre on this topic, which was published in reputed journal of 'Indian Heart Journal'mentioned at the end of the article. Out of total 3656 patients who underwent PCI, 367 patients were found to be less than 45 years of age. Some of the findings are as follows. \n\u2022\tThough men make up the majority of patients in this age group, CAD in females under the age of 45 is not uncommon. \n\u2022\tApproximately 9\u201311% of all CAD cases are caused by obstructive CAD in young people, which is a distinct entity with a distinctive risk factor profile, clinical appearance, angiographic profile, and therapeutic outcome. \n\u2022\tTraditional risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, abdominal obesity, smoking, and alcohol intake are on the rise in younger women and are on par with men. \n\u2022\tSTEMI is a typical presentation of CAD, and single-vessel disease is a more common form of angiographic pattern in the young, and the most common culprit vessel beingLAD. \n\u2022\tYounger patients are treated with PCI as the primary modality, and they perform better with few complications. \nIn terms of risk factors, genetics, sociocultural processes, biological factors, and pathophysiology, men and women present differently for obstructive CAD. Women with suspected ischemia are frequently ignored, according to a number of indisputable pieces of evidence. Young women have an about 50% higher mortality risk than young men, most likely as a result of less intensive early diagnostic and therapeutic care for women. In spite of the fact that hormone protection may help women delay atherosclerosis, our research shows that at a young age, the multiple risk factors entirely outweigh the advantage. \nSimilar to our findings, Iragavarapu et alstudies in south India found that the average age of CAD in young individuals was 36.11 years and that males outnumbered females. According to earlier research, women experience CAD 10 years later than men. According to recent Indian population studies, traditional risk factors like hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidaemia, which were earlier more common in men, are now increasing in young Indian women. The INTERHEART study also found that young Indian women were more likely than men to have diabetes and hypertension as immediate risk factors. The prevalence of obstructive CAD in young women aged 45 is 3.1 %to 4.4 %. The presence of risk factors in young females is one of the strongest predictors of CAD since, females with risk factors had a higher prevalence of obstructive CAD (89.4%) than did females without risk factors (10.6%). \nAccording to computed tomography of the heart, women's coronary arteries are smaller than men. Han et al. discovered that whereas women had more microvascular dysfunction, males had more atheroma and epicardial endothelial dysfunction in their research of men and women with early CAD. In an autopsy study conducted by Vaideeswar et al., 88.4 percent of young patients had obstructive CAD caused by atherosclerosis, with females accounting for 15.5 percent of the patient population. Naturally, the LAD was the most impacted, and fibrous plaques began to form. Regardless of plaque morphology, thrombosis caused by plaque erosion was the most common cause, involving both sexes and occurring in 36.9 percent of patients. \nAcute coronary syndrome was the most common presentation in multiple studies involving young participants, similar to the CREATE registry, which documented STEMI in 61% of patients. Iragavarapu et al. discovered that single-vessel disease was the most common kind of vascular illness among 120 young South Indian patients who presented with acute coronary syndrome at a tertiary care hospital (10.4 percent). In our analysis, we discovered about 5.5 percent of participants had triple vessel disease. \nObesity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, and diabetes are all preventable conditions that can be managed and treated. The fact that 'women are less likely to smoke' is something that is thing of the past. In younger age groups, there is a larger window of opportunity for early CAD prevention. Post-menopausal women were found to have a higher prevalence of risk factors than pre-menopausal women. Pre-menopausal women stand to benefit the most from taking precautions against these risk factors. Targeted regulation of hypertension, obesity, cholesterol levels, and glycemia is required to reduce disease burden, with a focus on educating the young about mitigating these risk factors. As a result, it appears that young Indians have an additional ten years to implement preventive measures and effectively combat the CAD threat.

{"title": "Hydrotherapy exercises can help easy joint pain", "date": "27 Sep 2022 5:01 PM GMT ", "description": "A particularly effective treatment for illnesses like arthritis and its complications is hydrotherapy or water therapy. In contrast to aqua aerobics, which typically entails physically demanding activities in the water, hydrotherapy exercise incorporates specialised movements that are performed in a warm-water swimming pool. The water is maintained between 32 and 36 degrees Celsius.\nHydrotherapy, also known as aquatic therapy, can be beneficial for those with joint discomfort. It is utilised particularly for those who have undergone joint replacement surgery, as well as for those with back pain, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and osteoarthritis. \nExercise that is done in a swimming pool is referred to as hydrotherapy exercise. The pool's depth is between the shoulders and the waist, and the water is kept at a comfortable temperature. \nExercises for hydrotherapy are typically carried out with the assistance of a physical therapist, somewhat similar to water aerobics sessions. \n\u2022\tPromote relaxation \n\u2022\tImprove blood circulation \n\u2022\tEase anxiety, depression and pain \n\u2022\tTreat musculoskeletal problems \nThose who have attempted to walk underwater know that it is more difficult to do so than it is on dry land. Walking becomes more difficult because of the water's resistance, which contributes to the development of muscle strength. However, since there is no gravity underwater, patients can use their muscles more actively and feel more comfortable. Patients' muscles that are generally not used during land therapy are activated by the therapy. \nRegular exercise is crucial and advantageous for persons with arthritis, according to research. Daily physical activity can enhance joint functionality, lessen symptoms like fatigue, reduce hospitalisation risk, and lower the risk of developing chronic diseases like heart disease that are linked to inflammatory arthritis, per a review written by the Best Practice & Research Clinical Rheumatology. Surprisingly, the majority of arthritis sufferers avoid activities because they think doing them will make their disease worse and make them feel awful. Despite the fact that land treatment is crucial for treating arthritic symptoms and joint pain, most patients report that these exercises hurt their joints and they don't like doing them. \nHowever, such patients find alleviation with hydrotherapy. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had hydrotherapy experienced less joint soreness and pain, according to a study published in the journal Musculoskeletal Care. Additionally, it improved their attitude, and they enjoyed the workout. \n\u2022\tIt can be an effective therapy to treat chronic pain \n\u2022\tThe therapy helps to loosen the tight, tense muscles while promoting relaxation. It also enhances the digestion activity and the metabolic rate \n\u2022\tThe water in the pool provides resistance to moving the joints. When someone pushes their legs and arms against the water, it assists in improving the muscle strength \n\u2022\tHydrotherapy also increases cardiorespiratory fitness, which is essential for good heart health \n\u2022\tStudies have also shown that specific inflammatory markers can decrease with hydrotherapy \n\u2022\tIt also stimulates blood circulation across the body \nCompared to land therapy, hydrotherapy may be more comfortable for people with arthritis or joint discomfort. When performing hydrotherapy exercises, it's crucial not to attempt it on your own and to always get professional assistance from a physical therapist.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/life-style/health/hydrotherapy-exercises-can-help-easy-joint-pain-763343"},

The Pixel 3 was the last flagship series to come to India, and Google is now bringing its Pixel 7 phones right away after skipping three major versions for this market. However, the exact release date and release details are still unknown. The search giant will officially announce the new set of Pixel phones in the global market on October 6, after which the devices will arrive in India. The Pixel 7 is expected to be priced in India below Rs 60,000, and the Pro variant will likely be available at a higher price. Here are five things about the Pixel 7 series that we already know.\n-Google has already confirmed that its second-generation Tensor chipset will power its new Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro smartphones. In its blog post, Google noted that \"the first Pixels built with Tensor -- Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro -- are the fastest selling Pixel phones to date.\"\n-The Pixel 7 series will retain the previous design. People will see a hole-punch display design on the front and a horizontal camera module on the back. There's no headphone jack, which isn't surprising considering smartphones have ceased to be offered with premium handsets.\n-The teasers shared by Google reveal that the standard model will include a dual rear camera setup, while the Pro model will feature three cameras on the rear. The company claims that the new Pixel 7 series will offer \"more detail\" while \"more focus\" and \"more magic\" (erasing tool). In one of the teasers, Google has shown the level of quality and detail that the device's 4x optical zoom can offer.\n-The Pixel 7 series will undoubtedly ship with Android 13 OS out of the box. Every year, Google launches new phones with the Android operating system. So, the same thing will happen this year too.\n-The company will not include a charger in the retail box of the Pixel 7 series, considering that Google opted for a charger-free policy with the launch of the Pixel 6 series. The Pixel 6a, launched earlier this year, will not come with an adapter. So one will have to spend more on the charger.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/technology/tech-news/google-is-coming-back-to-the-indian-market-with-pixel-7-series-764172"},

The satellite battery has drained,\" sources in the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) revealed. \"The link has been lost\". \nThere was, however, no official word from the country's national space agency, headquartered here. \nWith fuel on board, ISRO had been performing orbital manoeuvres on MOM spacecraft to take it to a new orbit to avoid an impending eclipse in the past. \"But recently there were back-to-back eclipses including one that lasted seven-and-half hours,\" officials said on condition of anonymity, noting that all the propellant on board the ageing satellite had been consumed. \n\"As the satellite battery is designed to handle eclipse duration of only about one hour and 40 minutes, a longer eclipse would drain the battery beyond the safe limit,\" another official said. \nISRO officials noted that the Mars orbiter craft functioned for almost eight years, well beyond its designed mission life of six months. \"It has done its job and yielded significant scientific results,\" they said. \nThe objectives of the mission were primarily technological and included design, realisation and launch of a Mars Orbiter spacecraft capable of operating with sufficient autonomy during the journey phase; Mars orbit insertion/ capture and in-orbit phase around Mars. The MOM -- a technology demonstration venture -- carried five scientific payloads (total 15 kg) collecting data on surface geology, morphology, atmospheric processes, surface temperature and atmospheric escape process. \nThe five instruments are: Mars Color Camera (MCC), Thermal Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (TIS), Methane Sensor for Mars (MSM), Mars Exospheric Neutral Composition Analyser (MENCA) and Lyman Alpha Photometer (LAP). \n\"MOM is credited with many laurels like cost-effectiveness, short period of realisation, economical mass-budget, and miniaturisation of five heterogeneous science payloads\", ISRO officials pointed out. \nHighly elliptical orbit geometry of MOM enabled Mars Color Camera to take snap shots of 'Full disc' of Mars at its farthest point and finer details from closest point. \nThe MCC has produced more than 1000 images and published a Mars Atlas. \nMeanwhile, plans on a follow-on 'Mangalyaan' mission to the red planet, however, are yet to be firmed up.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/technology/tech-news/with-drained-battery-no-fuel-indias-mars-orbiter-quietly-bids-adieu-763993"},
{"title": "Govt issues fresh safety norms to prevent industrial mishaps", "date": "3 Oct 2022 11:36 PM GMT ", "description": "In light of recent industrial accidents in the State, the Andhra Pradesh government has notified fresh safety guidelines to institutionalise preventive measures to check accidental leakage of toxic gases and dangerous chemicals in factories.\nMadireddy Pratap, Director General of AP Disaster Response and Fire Services (DRFS), said the new guidelines issued under the AP Fire Service Act, 1999, would go a long way in averting accidents in industrial units. \"Democratic checks and balances resulting from public disclosure will go a long way in preventing major disasters,\" Pratap pointed out. Periodic mock drills and community awareness programmes are some of the preventive measures that are now being mandated for industrial units. \nUnder Section 14(1) of the Act, all companies and industries, including ports, which store or process any toxic, hazardous or explosive chemicals, are required to disclose that information every three months. That will enable the first responders -- police, fire services and health personnel -- to conduct joint mock drills and also create awareness among the local communities on the likely hazards and possible preventive measures, according to the DG. \n\"Any violation of the minimum safety provisions will attract prosecution not only under the AP Fire Service Act but also under the Indian Penal Code (IPC),\" the DG warned. A spate of accidents over the last few years, in which many lives were lost, exposed the lack of preparedness and adequate safety norms in industrial units with preventive mechanisms found wanting. Various official committees that probed into these accidents have established the omissions on part of the managements and insufficient infrastructure to handle such major accidents. \nThat there is no basic information about the nature and the amount of chemicals and gases stored in many of the industrial units leaves the first responders clueless and unprepared to handle an emergency situation, the committees have noted. In May 2020, leak of styrene vapour from LG Polymers plant near Visakhapatnam left 12 persons dead and close to 1,000 people sick. In April 2022, an explosion in Porus Laboratories in West Godavari district killed 10 people. \nIn June this year, leak of poisonous gas from a company in the industrial area in Anakapalli district left over 200 workers in an apparel manufacturing unit sick, which was located away from it. \nThe source of the leak took many weeks to be established. A month later, there was again a gas leak from an \"outside source\" but over 300 workers, mostly women, of the apparel unit fell ill. Had information relating to storage of toxic chemicals in factories been made public, it would have been easy to pinpoint the source in case of a leak and take immediate steps to contain it. \nThere are 278 cold storage units in the State, most of which are used for storing dry red chillies. Going by past incidents of fire that reduced the cold storage facilities to ashes in some parts of the State, the DRFS conducted experiments - in coordination with ONGC and industry experts - using liquid nitrogen, aerosol and liquid carbon dioxide to douse the blaze. \nWhile DRFS is acquiring fire tenders, with liquid carbon dioxide capacity of 10,000 kg each, to be stationed near clusters of cold storages, isolated units have been directed to maintain a bank of liquid carbon dioxide cylinders to handle emergency fires. \nThe new guidelines that have been issued also suggested putting in place a 'decentralised fire safety system' and installing automatic heat and temperature sensing devices, fire detection and alarm systems. Industrial units have been authorised to use foam generators to contain oil-related fires. \nNoting that \"no industry is an island\", DG Pratap mandated that industrial units located in a vicinity sign \"mutual aid agreements\" to fight fires. There are 220 pharmaceutical units in the State, many with multiple exothermic reactors. Explosion of these reactors due to runaway exothermic reactions has been identified as the root cause of fatal accidents. The DRFS, accordingly, has asked the managements of the pharmaceutical companies to adopt latest safety technologies, besides posting qualified and well-trained employees to handle the reactors. \"We can have equipment to fight fire but not an explosion. Hence, all care is to be taken to avoid conditions leading to an explosion that don't give any time for it to escalate,\" Pratap observed.(PTI)", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/andhra-pradesh/govt-issues-fresh-safety-norms-to-prevent-industrial-mishaps-764151"},

He described them as the true builders of the city and the contribution of sanitary officers Chenchaiah and Sumathi was unforgettable. The award was possible because of the hard work of all Municipal Corporation of Tirupati (MCT) staff for the past three years under the guidance of former Commissioner PS Girisha and the present Commissioner Anupama Anjali. City Mayor Dr R Sirisha, the two deputy mayors, corporators and all others were involved so much in this task and worked with dedication to make everyone proud. The MLA recalled that out of the 159 cities across the country which received the awards, the name of Tirupati was called first which can be cherished. Mayor Dr Sirisha said that Tirupati got a 5 star rating in the garbage free city category which was an improvement from the 3 star rating in the previous year. It also got the best clean city award under the 1-10 lakh population category. \nThe very idea behind the Swachh Bharat initiative was to make some selected cities as garbage free cities and to take forward the concept of waste to wealth by creating wealth with the waste. The MCT has been collecting the garbage with 100 auto-rickshaws and the waste to wealth management has been effectively done at Thukivakam. \nAdditional Commissioner Sunitha, Deputy commissioner Chandramouleeswar Reddy, Deputy Mayor Mudra Narayana, revenue officer Lokeswara Varma, Superintending engineer T Mohan, MEs Chandrasekhar, Venkatrami Reddy and others were present.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/news/cities/tirupathi/srinivasa-setu-2nd-phase-to-be-inaugurated-today-764271"},

{"title": "Andhra Pradesh government reverses 'historic' decision, restores interviews for Group-1 posts", "date": "4 Oct 2022 7:57 PM GMT ", "description": "Job aspirants, particularly those seeking to get into executive cadre posts, will have to undergo a personality test as the state government rescinded its previous order dispensing with personal interviews.\nIn June 2021, the state government issued an order dispensing with personal interviews for recruitment of staff, calling it a \"historic decision\" aimed at maintaining \"utmost transparency\" and ensuring \"complete trust\" in the recruitment process for government jobs. \nRecruitment for all categories of government posts was supposed to be done only based on a written examination. \nBut it has now reversed its policy, to do away with the transparent process and bring back the old system, albeit with a new nomenclature called 'personality test.' \n\"The government, after careful consideration of the matter, hereby restores the personality test for higher level posts of Group-1 services for recruiting suitable and meritorious candidates for effective and efficient delivery of public services,\" state chief secretary Sameer Sharma said in an order (on September 30) which, however, was not made public. \nAfter a gap of over four years, the APPSC issued a notification on September 30 for filling up 92 Group-1 cadre posts in the state government and made a mere mention of the latest order on personality test. \nOn an average, about 60,000 candidates appear for the Group-1 preliminary exam and about 10,000 for the main. For Group-2 and others, the number will be over two lakh. \nThe Group-1 posts include deputy collector, deputy superintendent of police, district registrars, audit officers and the like. \nWhen asked about the rationale behind the government's policy reversal, a top official of the AP Public Service Commission (APPSC) only remarked that \"wiser sense prevailed.\" \n\"The decision to dispense with personal interviews was apparently based on some misguided suggestion. We have consulted the Union Public Service Commission and also constituted an experts committee and recommended that a personality test be conducted for at least Group-1 posts,\" the official said. \nAccordingly, the government came out with the fresh order restoring the personality test. \nIt would be a \"structured personality test\" wherein the character (mental and emotional) analysis of the candidates would be done. \n\"We can't simply recruit candidates without assessing their qualities and attributes, which is possible only through personal interface. The personality test will help us determine a candidate's best suitability for civic service,\" the official said. \nThe APPSC has constituted three separate boards, each comprising two IAS and IPS officers, an academician of the rank of a university vice-chancellor, a member of the APPSC, besides the chairman. (PTI) \n\"We have put in place an efficient and tamper-proof system that leaves no scope for manipulation,\" the APPSC official asserted, rebutting claims that the personal interview was restored to please certain members of the commission, who were 'political appointees.' \nAPPSC secretary (in-charge) H Arun Kumar said the personal interview carried only about 10 per cent of the total marks. \n\"There will be a 360-degree review of the all-round personality of each candidate,\" he said. \nOn October 17, 2019, the CMO announced, \"Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy has taken a historic decision to do away with personal interviews in recruitment.\" \nOn June 26, 2021, the Chief Minister's historic decision finally got translated into a formal government order, which said only written examinations would be conducted for all categories of posts, including the Group-1 services, in all recruitments to be notified henceforth. \nCalling it a \"major reform,\" the government said the move to dispense with the interview process was \"to maintain utmost transparency and ensure complete trust of the competing candidates in the entire selection process.\" \nWay back in the year 2011, the then united AP government headed by N Kiran Kumar Reddy, did away with the interview process for all subordinate services as part of the reforms introduced in APPSC recruitments. \nThe reforms were implemented as per the recommendations made by a high-level committee headed by the then special chief secretary J Satyanarayana. \nWritten tests and interviews were, however, retained for executive posts like deputy collector, deputy superintendent of police, commercial taxes officer, regional transport officer and the like. The Jagan Mohan Reddy government altered that policy last year but has now backtracked.

Over the years, bommala koluvu has grown into something beyond just displaying a collection of dolls. \nThere are a plenty of sets that would resurface at koluvu such as treasurer of the Gods Kubera laying his plumpy hand on a mongoose and his consort Bhadra with their pots of treasures in front of them, Bhakta Kanappa standing on a leg, wielding an arrow that aims at his eye, Shiva Parvathi kalyanam, Srinvasa kalyanam, the image of Mahishasura Mardini with her tongue sticking out while holding a trident pointing at the demon lying helpless at her feet, the stoic Rama along with adorable Sita, Lakshman and Hanuman and then the mandatory wedding set, a slice of rural life that features a well, so on and so forth. \"Our tradition and culture are so beautiful. Unfortunately, they are slowly fading into oblivion for various reasons. Setting up a koluvu epitomises mythological themes such as Ramayana, Mahabharata along with other stories associated with Gods and Goddesses. The medium not only aids in narrating the tales to the younger generation but also passing our culture to them. When people visit home to view the koluvu and usher in Goddesses through music, it fills the ambience with positive energy and vibration,\" explains G Shanti, who has set up an elaborate bommala koluvu with a mix of traditional and contemporary themes at her residence in Nowroji Road. \n Although most of the shelves occupy Gods and Goddesses, innovative themes dot the steps too. \"This year, we introduced the Harry Potter series that has Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and Disney stories as they will certainly catch the attention of the children. Also, sets such as vodugu barasala and sashti poorthi form a part of the display comprising 3,000 idols at home,\" says GSVS Girija, an entrepreneur, who dedicated an entire floor for the koluvu arrangement. \nFor some, Navaratri is the time to invite people home and tell a story. \"What we heard during our childhood remains etched in our memory. Each idol set has a story to tell. For instance, not many know why the Asuras were tricked while churning the ocean of milk to retrieve 'amrit'.

{"title": "Chiru to 'play' GodFather to Pawan", "date": "4 Oct 2022 7:03 PM GMT ", "description": "Signalling a new churn to the AP politics in the coming days, Megastar Chiranjeevi on Tuesday reiterated that his exit from politics would certainly help Pawan Kalyan's Jana Sena in the upcoming elections.\nLike a film teaser, Chiranjeevi has been making one-line statements loaded with political overtones these days. His first sensational dialogue was from his upcoming film 'GodFather' which gave an indication of his intention to remain as godfather to Jana Sena chief and his younger brother Pawan Kalyan. \nChiranjeevi's speech at the business promotion of his latest film in Anantapur the other day had led to political speculation when he stated, \"I may be out of politics, but politics is not out of me\". No doubt, it was a dialogue from his upcoming film. Yet the significance was not lost on anybody. \nIn addition, Chiranjeevi predicted that his brother would be a great politician and a good leader and hoped that people would give him a chance. He also added that his exit from politics and remaining silent would lend strength to him (for a good measure). He is my brother. I know how committed he is. His thoughts are not polluted,\" he added. \nYet another development - a meeting of fans of Chiranjeevi, Pawan Kalyan and Ramcharan held at Vijayawada recently - should also come as a shocker to the YSRCP. Swami Naidu, All India Chiranjeevi Fan Club president, had declared after the meeting that their goal and aim was to see Pawan Kalyan as Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh after 2024 general elections. \nThese fans would not have met to chalk a political programme without any signal from their heroes, it is being said. More meetings are being followed by these people to plan a joint effort in the next elections. \nThe silence of Chiranjeevi was taken for granted by the YSRCP leadership to claim indirect support for the latter. The reported proximity of Chiranjeevi with Jagan was always touted as a proof of the same. \nWhile the BJP would only be thrilled with the prospect of the mega family's open support to Pawan Kalyan and the party, the YSRCP and its strategic mentor IPAC will have their hands full in revisiting their plans. AP Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy has been insisting that there should be nothing less than 175 seats for the party in 2024.

As Amaravati farmers are taking out Maha Padayatra from Tullur to Arasavalli in Srikakulam district to press their demand of keeping Amaravati as the sole capital of the state, the YSRCP is making efforts to get support of people in a big way on three capital issue. As part of its strategy, the state government started organising round-table conferences in Godavari and Visakhapatnam districts. YSRCP state general secretary and government advisor Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy in a video conference with party leaders asked them to conduct round-table meets on three capitals to push aggressively the party's narrative that TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu's Amaravati capital is 'nothing but a real estate venture for 29 villages'.\nChief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy stated in recent Assembly session that the government would not budge from its stand of three capital. He also claims that opposition parties are trying to incite farmers against the government though majority of people are supporting three capital. \nIn accordance with this policy, YSRCP leaders began a campaign to counter Amravati farmers' padayatra when it entered West Godavari district. Flexis were erected with slogans of 'Amaravati farmers go back'. The ruling party leaders, ministers and MLAs are openly commenting that North Andhra people 'will not tolerate' the Amaravati farmers padayatra and the TDP was organising the padayatra to create regional differences among people of three regions. \nThe state government appears to be keen on diluting the impact of Amravati farmers' padayatra and at the same time carrying out three capital formula as a topic of debate topic among people. As part of the government's move, YSRCP leaders including MLAs and Ministers are vying with each other to highlight importance of three capitals and at the same time attacking the Amaravati farmers' padayatra.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/andhra-pradesh/ysrcp-out-to-make-3-capitals-a-topic-of-debate-among-people-764267"},

Apart from APSRTC, hundreds of buses from Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Odisha and Chhattisgarh reach this station every day. \nThere are over 146 stalls on the bus stand premises, of which 60 per cent are cool drink shops and others are food stalls and electrical items selling shops. The departure terminals have almost 70 per cent of the total stalls. \nWith this huge rush, the stall owners and sellers formed a ring to sell items at higher prices more than MRP. They are virtually extorting money from customers on every purchase of food items, soft drinks, popcorn, biscuits and other snacks.

The renewed thrust on reducing logistics costs assumes significance, as the country aims to substantially raise its merchandise exports to $1 trillion by FY28 from $422 billion in FY22. The policy is likely to change India's logistics sector, boost seamless movement of goods and reduce carbon footprints. The policy also likely to bring down the transportation, warehousing and inventory costs, which will consequently reduce the overall logistics cost down to around 8% of GDP in the next five years. The policy is also expected to generate massive employment opportunities and address skill issues in the sector. \nThe PM GatiShakti\u2014National Master Plan for multi-modal connectivity\u2014launched by the Prime Minister last year, was a pioneering step in this direction. PM GatiShakti will get further boost with the launch of National Logistics Policy, will act as a 'double engine' to transform the state of the country's logistics sector. \nHowever, the AP Chambers suggests certain measures for the development of logistics Sector in the country and particularly in AP including development of Multimodal Logistics Park in all the nodes of industrial corridors passing through Andhra Pradesh i.e VCIC and CBIC corridors, early completion of the Railway new freight corridors as envisaged by the union government \u2013East Coast corridor from West Bengal's Kharagpur to Vijayawada and North South sub-corridor Vijayawada-Nagpur- Itarsi (Madhya Pradesh), AP is the gateway to South East Asia with four major ports and six more ports under development along the 1000-km coast line of the State. Development of hubs like Air Freight Stations, Inland Container Depots, Container Freight Stations, cargo terminals, which are hubs for intermediary activities (storage, handling, value addition, inter-modal transfers, etc.) in the supply chain will help and promote AP as South East gateway for International Trade, completion of National Waterways (NW-4) project from Kakinada to Pondicherry to reduce transportation costs, the Indian container manufacturing industry is in its beginning stages. The country is still dependent on China for its shipping container supplies. There is an urgent need to promote container manufacturing in India and also to develop world class supply chain and logistics companies like UPS, FEDEX, Maersk, API etc to reduce over dependence on those global firms and AP has the biggest natural advantage to become the logistics hub, since major National Highways, National Railways, \nNational waterways NW- 4 (under development), major airports traverse almost together side by side all along the 1000-km coast line linking the Major Sea ports and also new sea ports under development.\nThe AP Chambers requested the prime minister to consider these suggestions to develop AP as the major logistic hub to promote the State as South East Gateway of the country for international trade.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/news/cities/vijayawada/cost-cutting-logistics-policy-a-welcome-measure-ap-chambers-763080"},

The footfall of tourists has increased.\nMore foreign tourists must be attracted to give jobs to locals. Karnataka has the best tourist places which are ideal for the promotion of tourism. The forts of Kalburagi and Bidar are fantastic. All these are our property and there is a big scope for tourism if these assets are improved. We have got all these from our ancestors and it must be introduced to the whole world. The government is doing the job of recognising them. \nThe CM said the departments of Revenue, Good and PWD must work as a team along with the Tourism Department. The existing places of tourist attractions will be fully utilised to promote tourism. They need to make Karnataka world famous. This requires the support of everyone. \"Saint Kanakadasa was born in Shiggaon taluk and it was also the karma bhumi of Saint Shishunala Sharif but these places are not developed. The excavation by the Department of Archaeology has discovered a small palace. There is a fort of Kanakadasaru and a palace. Efforts are made to keep the saint alive by constructing a 4D studio and other measures.

Revival of Yaana, ropeway in Chikmagalur and hotels have been taken up. New circuits are formulated and Singh has a major role in this endeavor. More improvement will be made in tourism with private and public participation in the coming days. \nHe called upon the tourist guides to work with dedication and honesty, and they must never lie or mislead tourists. The Karnataka tourist guides must become number one and every tourist must talk about their honesty in guiding visitors. The officials of the Tourist Department must become active and make optimum use of their capacity to improve tourism. In fact, the hotel industry has a lot of opportunities in the tourism industry. Sigh has started the construction of three-star hotels in Hampi, Badami and Belur. Lots of development are taking place and they must make use of it. The local youths should get jobs and Karnataka has to become world-famous. \nThe CM said technology has brought in changes in the tourism sector and this industry has been a main focus in some of the countries in the world. It is growing in the country too. Both government and private sectors must create good infrastructure for the development of tourism. Tourists expect good boarding, good food and good services. More jobs are created because of this industry. Karnataka is blessed with the wonders like Hampi, Belur, Halebeedu, Golgumbaz and Jain Basadis created by kings. By protecting these historic monuments they can attract tourists. These architectural marvels must be introduced to the people. UNESCO has already identified Hampi as a World Heritage Centre and shortly Belur and Halebid are expected to be included in that list. The Badavi caves and Ajanta Caves are old and important but tourists do not know much about it. \nBommai said two tourist circuits are being worked.

{"title": "Rise of PCOS and the impact of infertility post-Covid", "date": "28 Sep 2022 1:54 AM GMT ", "description": "Post the pandemic, many teenagers and young women have started complaining about menstrual abnormalities and cases of PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) have increased. It is a condition where a woman suffers from hormonal imbalance resulting in development of numerous small cysts (fluid filled sacs) in the ovaries.\nSince September is PCOS Awareness Month, a trend being observed by the doctors at Motherhood Hospitals. PCOS can cause complications like weight gain, irregular periods, acne and may also lead to infertility. It has also been known to affect mental health as well \nImpact of Covid 19 on PCOS was of stress and physical inactivity during the pandemic have been major factors leading to the spike in the number of PCOS cases. While the world battled a deadly virus, other health issues, like PCOS took a back seat. Women with this condition either failed to recognise the symptoms or did not get themselves treated which exacerbated the situation. \nTo elaborate more on this, Motherhood Hospitals, Indiranagar, Bengaluru, Consultant \u2013 Obstetrician and Gynaecologist, Dr Suhasini Inamdar said, \"We have been witnessing a sharp rise in the number of PCOS cases since the outbreak of the pandemic primarily because of several lifestyle changes brought about by Covid. The covid-induced lockdowns enforced a lack of physical activity which is directly linked to hormone disruptions, increased stress levels and weight gain, which can lead to conditions like PCOS. In fact, it is believed that women with PCOS are more likely to suffer from a severe bout of COVID infection. A possible reason for the same could be attributed to insulin resistance and excess quantities of androgen which deter the immune system's ability to fight the virus.\" \nShe said, 'We are seeing 8-10 cases per month, especially young girls who are aged between 15-18 years and the post-Covid rise in cases is around 30%. While there is no complete cure for PCOS, its symptoms can be managed with the help of treatment. Additionally, women with PCOS are also recommended to adopt a healthier lifestyle by consuming a well-balanced diet, full of various nutrients and limiting their carbs and processed food intake. Since more than 50% of the women suffering from PCOS are overweight, it is suggested that they exercise for at least 30 minutes every day. However, indulging in heavy exercising is also not recommended', Dr Inamdar said. \nShe added, Women with PCOS are more likely to suffer from anxiety disorders and mood swings, practicing meditation and mindfulness can help in calming the mind. The Nova IVF Fertility Bengaluru, Fertility Consultant, Dr. Apurva Satish Amarnath said, \"Your PCOS can impact your fertility in different ways. One of the commonest manifestations of PCOS is that ovulation doesn't happen regularly, and women have irregular cycles. This happens due to hormone imbalances of the reproductive hormones. Even in circumstances where ovulation occurs, hormonal imbalances may play a key role in preventing the endometrium lining of the uterus to develop completely, hence, implantation of an embryo may not occur. Hormonal imbalances can lead to menstrual and ovulatory irregularities. Irregular cycles can bring down your chances of a natural conception.\" \nWhile PCOS is the most prevalent cause of infertility in women, however, it is not impossible to get pregnant. In addition to techniques that boost chances of getting pregnant naturally, there are several Assisted Reproductive Technologies which have been gaining traction in the last few years, Dr Apurva said. \nShe added, 'In case a plan is to conceive later in the future, one can also consider opting for an embryo freezing or cryopreservation technique wherein a fertilized egg is frozen and stored for a delayed implantation. Both egg and embryo freezing require the concerned person to be administered with fertility drugs that stimulate ovaries to produce multiple eggs to boost chances of a successful fertilization. Post the age of 35, fertility starts waning in women and those who suffer from conditions like PCOS have a heightened chance of being infertile as time passes by. \nIVF can also be opted for women suffering from PCOS to help them get pregnant at a later stage in life, provided the quality of their eggs are good. However, the earlier you opt for an IVF procedure, the better the chances of success' she concluded.

Considering the current developments in the state government, the ZP and TP elections will be held only after the assembly elections.\nOn the one hand, the Delimitation Commission has asked for another three months for demarcation of constituencies. On the other hand, after the constituencies are fixed, the state government has set a limit of three months to complete the reservation process. \nIn this way, the process of scheduling and reservation of constituencies will take place for another six months i.e. till March 2023. The State Election Commission needs at least one month to prepare the voter list after the completion of the reservation process as the delimitation of the constituencies. After issuing the final reservation notification, it takes one and a half month to issue the election time list.\n Even if the election is held in at least two phases, it will take at least 1 month. Meanwhile, if the assembly election process starts, the process of TP and GP elections will be further delayed. As the Karnataka Gram Swaraj and Panchayat Raj Act has been amended to fix the number of members and population for the TP and GP constituencies, a lot of time is required for the restructuring of the constituencies. Therefore, the Delimitation Commission requested the state government on September 19 to extend the period of the commission by three months. In the meantime, the government has requested the High Court to extend the deadline given on May 24, 2022 by another 6 months to complete the process of delimitation and reservation of TP and GP constituencies within 12 weeks. \nThe Vijayanagar district came into existence after the formation of Boundary Delimitation Commission. Before the formation of the commission there were 30 districts and 233 taluks. Then there are 31 districts and 238 talukas. In the meantime, many village councils have been upgraded to urban local bodies. Therefore, the commission said that more time is needed. The Boundary Delimitation Commission said 30 days time is required to bring a fresh proposal from the District Collector. As 15 days for scrutiny of proposals, 15 days for invitation of objections to restructuring proposals and their scrutiny. Another 15 days to finalize suggestions on draft notification and 15 days to conduct adalats at district level on objections. It takes one week to submit the final report. \nGovernment said, six months time is required to complete the process of scheduling and reservation of TP and GP constituencies. If this time is not available, it will not be possible to redistribute the TP and GP constituencies due to the increase in the number of talukas and districts due to law changes and other developments. This will render the entire election process null and void. \nThe Election Commission said after the selection of constituencies, after the completion of the reservation process, it takes at least one month to publish the voter list for TP, GP elections. After that time is required for publication of election notification and election time list.

Rahul Gandhi, who is on Bharat Jodo Yatra, celebrated Gandhi Jayanti at Badanavalu Khadi Gramodyog Kendra. He won the hearts of the villagers with his sympathy, sharing of food .\nBadanavalu, a tiny village off Mysore-Chamarajanagar state highway hit the national headlines when three Dalits in the village were killed by upper class Lingayats on March 25,1993.Three Dalits were brutally murdered by a mob of Lingayats after the dispute over entry of Dalits into a Siddeshwara temple . The death of the Dalits led to a public debate on the safety of Dalits in the state besides causing deep division between communities, particularly between the Dalits and Lingayats who dominate the region. \nHowever, before the wounds of this social-hatred were healed, Dalits went retaliated and set on fire several houses of Lingayats at a nearby village called Ummathur. Following widespread protests the state government handed over the case to CBI. Of the 23 accused, twenty men were convicted of killing three Dalits during the Badanavalu clashes in 1993, and were finally sentenced to life imprisonment on November 4, 2010. \nSince the past 29 years both communities did not have cordial relationship. On Sunday Rahul Gandhi invited both communities for lunch and caused reunion of both communities. Rahul Gandhi also inaugurated the 180-metre long road ,developed with pavers ,which was not in use since last 29 years following clash. Rahul also named after the road as Bharat Jodo road and planted saplings at Khadi gramodyog Kendra premises to mark his visit. \nSpeaking to this paper on Sunday Badanavalu gram panchayat member and Lingayat community leader B N Manjunath told that the road filled with bushes and parthenium as both communities not using it after clash.

With an Agatston score of over 400, 150 of these persons (4 per cent) had a 90 per cent risk of having a heart attack but were fully ignorant of it. They were saved just in time since a preventive health checkup allowed for the early diagnosis of their ailment.\nA coronary calcium scan can detect and measure calcium-containing plaque in the arteries said Dr. Tausif Ahmed Thangalvadi, Medical Director at NURA. \n\"This plaque can grow and lead to narrowing of coronary arteries and increased risk of heart attack. Plaque in arteries is more common in men than women, and its incidence increases with age. Heart Calcium score uses low-dose CT scan to take cross-sections of the blood vessels of the heart to look for build-up of calcified plaques made of fats, cholesterol, calcium and other substances in the blood. This calcium is different from the calcium in the bones and is not related to calcium in our diet. The Heart Calcium Score helps us identify a person at risk of a heart attack even before signs and symptoms develop,\" he added. \nTalking about how Heart Calcium Store is different from other heart tests, he added \" An ECG or Echo can pick up a heart attack only after it occurs. A normal ECG or Echo does not rule out the risk or presence of atherosclerotic plaques. A treadmill test measures the ability of the heart to increase its blood flow under physical stress. It can pick up the risk of a heart attack only if the coronary artery narrowing reaches a critical stage.\" \nHowever, today heart Calcium Score is recommended for screening cardiac risk in asymptomatic people, and an angiogram in those who are symptomatic. \"A Heart Calcium Score can be done once a year to pick up any coronary artery disease at an early stage. People with a zero score can also be reassured about their heart and avoid unnecessary medications,\" remarked Dr. Tausif. \nAs per the WHO Global Health estimates 2016, nearly 11 per cent of the population in India is suffering from coronary artery disease (heart disease). This means that 1 out of 10 Indians has heart disease, which is much higher than the world average. \"Heart disease is the highest killer contributing to nearly 50 per cent of all deaths in India. And this becomes of much more concern when we realise that Indians have heart disease at a younger age and with higher mortality,\" he concluded.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/karnataka/one-in-5-asymptomatic-individuals-diagnosed-with-calcified-plaque-in-heart-763271"},

Satisfied with the court order, the aspirants are ready to jump into the election arena. Some have started campaigning. However, the corporation's election future still hangs in the balance. \nThe ball of the election controversy has fallen from the Supreme Court to the High Court. A single member bench headed by Justice Hemantha Chandan Gowder heard and disposed of the writ petitions filed by 8 persons including K Mahadeva of Ejipur, Palani Dayalan of Kammanahalli, V Srinivas of Doddabanasawadi and K Chandrasekhar of Naganathpur objecting to the discrimination in BBMP ward wise reservation. \nThe State Government should provide the Justice Bhaktavatsala Committee with actual figures regarding reallocation of reserves. The bench ordered that the reservation should be announced by November 30 and elections to the corporation should be held by December 31.

The government's intention to give 16 weeks time for rescheduling of reservation has been revealed. \nBJP, Congress, JDS MLAs do not want to hold corporation elections. Everyone knows this.

The High Court has ruled that the reservation list should be published on November 30.

It has been decided to file a writ by the public on behalf of the state government. \nThere are a lot of ticket aspirants in every ward of BBMP. MLAs reckon that if the election is held now, those deprived of tickets will turn against them and the Assembly elections will be adversely affected. Thus, ruling and opposition legislators are not favoured for elections. Elections should be held by December 31 as ordered by the High Court. Otherwise, the election to the corporation will not be held until the 2023 assembly elections are over. Elections are not allowed for three months before and three months after the general election.

We are seeing the social space sinking in size and value due to many factors, I consider BJY as a brave move and a prudent initiative to reclaim that space for the Indian society through this well-thought-of and well-planned people connect programme. 'Bharat Jodo needs to be seen as part of reclaiming the spaces for articulation, spaces for democratic voices, spaces for inclusivity, spaces for development Model that stands for equity and social recognition, it is also to reclaim the shrinking spaces for tolerance, dialogue and alternative narratives.

Most of the hotels, lodges, resorts wore a deserted look pre Dasara , now owners have reason to cheer.\nThe state government decided to celebrate Dasara in grand manner as the tourists are flocking the city. The long wait of two years by hotel owners did not go in vain. In the wake of mid-term vacation for Nada Habba, Mysuru Dasara and AICC former president Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra, all the rooms at hotels, guest houses and clubs in the city are full. That apart, the authorities concerned have even taken the marriage halls. The tourists irrespective of inter-state and international have booked the rooms in advance. \nDasara holidays are declared for schools from September 30 to October 6. Hence all types of rooms in and outside the city near outer-ring road junctions are 100 per cent occupied, said C Narayan Gowda, president of Hotel Owners Association, Mysuru. There are over 10,500 rooms in and around the city, added Gowda. Though it was predicted that it might take months for the nosedived industry to get back on its feet, major city hoteliers say that business has picked up though not on full scale. It is showing signs of full recovery and the sector will revive during the festive season. \nFor stakeholders this is not the proverbial new dawn as the hotel sector's survival and fortunes hinge on the number of tourists arriving in the city. However, the tourism industry too is showing signs of recovery as more than 16,000 tourists have landed up at Mysore Palace and Mysuru Zoo this week. \nThose in the hotel industry and tourism related business are happy as the occupancy rate in hotels and dine-ins have improved. Speaking to The Hans India, S. Vijay Selvaraj, Director, Sales and Marketing, Radisson Blu Plaza Hotel, said that recovery after the first wave was sluggish and it took over four months to recover while the recovery now is fast and the industry is showing signs of bouncing back with full vigour. \n\"People are travelling now and there are increased bookings in terms of people while in the first wave people were not coming out. Now they are more aware of the vaccines and staying on guard. Also, allied industries like the manufacturing segment too are in full swing.

In this regard, fresh tenders have been invited for ward-wise garbage disposal.\nTenders have been invited in 89 packages for garbage disposal in all 243 wards of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). A package has been prepared by combining three or four wards. It has been decided to collect and dispose wet, dry, sanitary waste (including covid waste), building debris, street waste and commercial waste in the Indore model. Eligible contractors will be responsible for waste management for 5 years. \nThe city generates 5,800 tonnes of garbage every day and the corporation has been spending more than Rs 1000 crore annually on waste collection, disposal, transportation and processing. Three years ago, different contractors were entrusted with the responsibility of collecting and disposing of raw and dry garbage from house to house. If the responsibilities of wet and dry waste disposal were assigned to different agencies, only raw waste was collected and disposed with the calculation that the problem of mixed waste generation could be controlled. However, even in the wards where this system has been implemented, the amount of mixed waste generation has not decreased. Even now in many wards the practice of heaping garbage continues. Thus, all garbage collection and disposal is given to a single agency. \nEarlier, the Corporation had invited tenders for garbage disposal in 100 wards and appointed contractors. This lease has expired. Therefore, separate tenders have been called for garbage disposal in all 243 wards of BBMP. Door-to-Door wet and dry waste, sanitary waste, hotel waste (except meat waste), waste generated in commercial outlets, building debris are collected and disposed in the units. \nAfter the BJP took over the administration of BBMP, the wet waste tender called during the Congress administration was abandoned and the solid waste management department of the Corporation implemented the Indore model on an experimental basis in some wards. After the end of the term of the people's representatives, it was again in trouble. Now Bangalore Solid Waste Management Company has been formed separately for waste management of the city and fresh tenders have been invited for all 243 wards.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/karnataka/bbmp-tender-for-garbage-disposal-in-243-wards-764127"},

The CAMPCO, however, is tizzy about the price fixation for the import of Arecanut into the country. Speaking to The Hans India, President of the multi-state Areca co-operative, Kishore Kumar Kodgi has requested the union commerce minister Piyush Goyal set the base price for the imported Areca at Rs. 360 per kg which will balance the price levels prevailing in the country. The CAMPCO has also averred that if not, it will be detrimental to the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in achieving double income for farmers. \nThis is not the first time that the DGFT has been approached by the Areca farmers and traders in their demand for the trade deficit balancing act. During the colossal losses that the Arecanut trade endured when the government moved to ban the consumption of Gutkha, 18 per cent of the Arecanut output was used by Gutkha manufacturers. Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh were the three states that joined the outcry. \nKarnataka, which has the largest share of production of areca at 1,60,000 tonnes at 38 per cent of the total of 4,15,000 tonnes of areca grown in the country annually. Followed by 25 per cent in Kerala and 20 per cent in Assam which are the major growers of areca. Nearly 3,75,000 hectares were under areca cultivation of which Karnataka alone was holding 1,90,000 hectares of land under areca. Since the gutkha industry was the major user of areca it was not a good idea to ban it feels the trading and farmer community. \nOver 20 lakh areca growers in the country were facing an uncertain future. The areca industry gives direct and indirect employment to over three crore people around the country. Nearly 13 million panwalas around the country were also making a livelihood by selling areca and areca products. \nAccording to sources, the Gutkha industry (Karnataka had 13 Gutkha producing units) was a Rs 1000- crore export market which will go into a tailspin. \"84 per cent of gutkha comprises of areca nut, what goes into the rest 16 per cent of a sachet of Gutkha may be objectionable, the government has to take an initiative to educate consumers of Gutkha just like they do for tobacco, I am yet to see tobacco being banned anywhere in the world\" CAMPCO sources stated. With the new import from Bhutan up to 17,000 metric tonnes, the question arises what will the country do with the additional influx of Arecanut? ask the industry honchos.

{"title": "Flat owners burdened with heavy repair costs, builders unconcerned", "date": "28 Sep 2022 2:04 AM GMT ", "description": " The repair cost of flats damaged by torrential rains in the Bengaluru has put the owners in financial trouble. Months of rain have undermined the infrastructure of the apartments in the city. Now crores of rupees need to be spent to repair the flats that were submerged in rain water for weeks. The builders have not agreed to bear the repair and infrastructure maintenance costs of the flats. So the flat owner has to bear this burden.\nApartment dwellers' welfare societies do not have a compensation fund to repair damage to buildings caused by floods or heavy rains. In addition, there is no financial assistance from the government or the local administration for the infrastructure of the apartments. \nAfter the rain subsided, the families who returned to the apartments cleaned their flats at their own expense. But, the question has started as to who will pay the compensation for the damage to the infrastructure of the entire apartment, elevators, drainage, water treatment plant etc. \nThe deluge has opened up a chasm between the state's real estate industry and its policies. 'The Karnataka Apartment Ownership Act (KAOA) is a specific act that ensures the transfer of flats. However, the Registration Act 1908 needs to be amended for proper implementation of this Act. However, this work has not been done so far,' says the legal expert. \nOnce a flat is purchased, a builder's conveyance deed should be executed. There the entire land title, along with undivided interest is transferred to the co-operative society and each flat buyer becomes a shareholder. Apartment dwellers welfare societies can be registered under KAOA and Karnataka Co-operative Societies Act 1959. However, experts opined that the state government has not communicated the rules to the competent authority for the last four decades. \n\"No conveyance deed has been issued by any builder in the state. Land records show the name of the land owner and not the apartment owner. Ownership of the buyer becomes complete when his share in the apartment and common areas is conveyed. Till then the property belongs to the promoters and as per Section 6 of KOFA, the developers have to maintain it at their own cost,'' experts said. \n'There are 325 villas in the layout. A lot of villa walls, waste water treatment plant, elevators were damaged due to rain. Repairing the collapsed walls will cost crores. Builders are not agreeing to bear this cost. So we have to suffer',says Rajesh Ram Mishra, Member Rainbow Drive Layout Residents Welfare Association. \n\"The waste water treatment plant, elevator and electrical appliances in the ground floor of the apartment were damaged by rainwater. Repairing these will cost at least Rs six crore. \nThe builders are responsible for this mess and the locals are demanding that they bear the cost of repairs. There is no fund collected by the flat buyers for management of unforeseen events. As the builders are not ready to pay the repair cost, we have to bear this financial burden,\" said Pranay Srivastava, member of the Residents' Welfare Association of Sterling Asentia Apartments..", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/karnataka/flat-owners-burdened-with-heavy-repair-costs-builders-unconcerned-763408"},

He showed the Congress leaders and workers why he has been made the chief of one of the top panels in the party. In fact, Patil launched a soft campaign trail in the coastal region of Karnataka, which is considered to be a hard nut to crack for the Indian National Congress. Patil who is a stickler for details and statistics did not forget to visit the Gokarnanatheshwara temple which is a big faith centre for Billava Community and was inaugurated by late prime minister Rajiv Gandhi. The tall leader of the Billava Community and former union minister B Janardhana Poojary initiated the development of this temple. MB Patil participated in the Pratishtapana Muhurtam of Sharada Mata Devi as a part of the Dasara festivities. He offered prayers to the presiding Deity of Gokarnanatheshwara at the temple. He was accompanied by MLA UT Khader, former MLAs Shakuntala Shetty, Ramanatha Rai, JR Lobo and former MLC Ivan D'Souza.\nThough Billavas were traditional voters of INC now they sway towards the BJP due to widespread saffronisation. But Patil's visit to the temple has sent good vibes across the Billava community. Patil also made it sure before leaving to tell his party men to win back the confidence of Billava leaders and workers. Harikrishna Buntwal once a staunch leader of the INC now has shifted to BJP \nPatil also met the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Mangaluru Dr Peter Paul D'Souza and exchanged views with him. He was accompanied by former MLA John Richard Lobo and former MLC Ivan D'Souza and MLA UT Khader and former minister B Ramanatha Rai. He discussed with the Bishop how INC was confident about making it back to power in the state. \nThe INC in Mangaluru City South constituency had always fielded Catholic candidates. Over 75 per cent of Catholic Christians are voters of INC. Patil's visit comes as a precursor to the campaign. More frequent interactions with Christian leaders in the constituency from the INC in the coming days appears to be on the cards. \nAddressing the party leaders and workers from the Dakshina Kannada Parliamentary constituency MB Patil urged them to take the failures of the Modi government and that of the Bommai government in the state to the people. In addition, they must remind them of the works in the socio-economic milieu that were promised but not carried out by these governments. He assured thm that the INC will form the government in 2023 in Karnataka with a whopping majority of not less than 130-140 seats, but before that, every worker and leader must put his best to make it happen through his hard work and intelligent work. He urged them to take up the issues that affect the common man's lives like inflation, and price rise in essential goods, food items, and services. \n He said one of the most burning problems was the growing rate of unemployment among the youth, which has to be discussed with society by the cadres and the leaders at the booth level. \nThey must also enrol new members. With such persuasive oratory capabilities Patil may take a couple of rounds of the state before the campaign is officially launched.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/karnataka/kpcc-campaign-chief-puts-congress-in-election-mode-763406"},
{"title": "Karnataka HC upholds tobacco products' double taxation", "date": "2 Oct 2022 5:38 PM GMT ", "description": "The National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD) and excise tax on tobacco products have been maintained by the Karnataka High Court. The order was issued by Justice M I Arun in response to applications filed by Ghodawat Packers LLP and five others challenging the imposition of NCCD. The petitioners argued that because there was no excise duty on tobacco and tobacco products from July 1, 2017, to July 6, 2019, NCCD could not be imposed. Therefore, NCCD shouldn't have been levied during that period.\nPrior to the Central Goods and Services Act of 2017, the Central Excise Act of 1944's tax laws applied to tobacco goods (read with Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985). The court stated that NCCD is a surcharge and a type of excise duty that can be imposed independently of the excise duty as contemplated under the provisions of the Fourth Schedule to the Central Excise Act, 1944, noting that repealing the Central Excise Act does not relieve the petitioners from paying NCCD as determined under the Seventh Schedule to the Finance Act. Therefore, the court concluded, the imposition of NCCD in the absence of the levy of excise duty cannot be regarded as illegal. \nThe court further stated that it would not interfere since the imposition of excise taxes on tobacco and tobacco-related products is a matter of public policy. \nIn addition to taxing tobacco and tobacco products in accordance with the CGST's rules, the CGST itself contemplates the imposition of an excise charge. There isn't a mistake. \nThe court ruled that the respondents, the Ministry of Finance and the Commissioner of Central Tax, are authorised to impose both the CGST and the excise duty on tobacco and tobacco-related products.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/karnataka/karnataka-hc-upholds-tobacco-products-double-taxation-763977"},

I am confident of batting anywhere in the order.'' \nThe Kerala batsman also said that players these days need to be flexible if they want to succeed at the highest level. ''You should not fix a spot for yourself. You cannot tell people: 'I am an opener or I am a finisher.' In the last three-four years, playing in various roles and spots (in order) has added a new dimension to my game,'' he added. \nSamson, who has played seven ODIs and 16 T20Is for India so far, went on to add that he is happy with the way he has been performing but wants to improve more. \n'It really does get challenging. Finding a place in the Indian team is really challenging. There is a lot of competition around, even within players who are in the team now. When these things happen, it is important to focus on myself,'' Samson said in response to a question.\n''I am happy with the way I am performing. I want to improve. 'The quality of cricketers we have in our team is unbelievable. So, it really helps each and every individual to raise their level. We keep on challenging ourselves. We try to perform every time we get an opportunity,'' the 27-year-old cricketer said further.\nSamson also said that there is not much difference between an A game and an international match because of the high competition at both levels. \n''They (India A games) are really important. There is not much difference between an A game and an international game. The competition is almost the same. So it is important to make use of the opportunities,\" said Samson. \nSamson was a part of India's tours of Ireland, West Indies, and Zimbabwe earlier this year. During a T20I in Dublin, he put up 176 runs with Deepak Hooda for the first wicket, which is a world record in the T20Is. \nAll three 50-over games between India A and New Zealand A are going to be played in Chennai. Earlier this month, these two sides locked horns in three unofficial Tests, where two games ended in a draw and India won the final game.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/focussing-on-my-performance-for-india-a-says-sanju-samson-after-missing-t20-world-cup-snub-762593"},

He made his presence felt in his comeback as he clocked bowling at 97mph and helped England seal the game by 63 runs. \nWood, who made his England debut in 2015, has been an injury-prone player and has missed many series because of the same. The 32-year-old pacer has now insisted that he is \"all in with England\" at the moment and is looking forward to playing Tests in Pakistan in the winter. \n\"One day we will have a conversation (about franchise cricket) but at the moment, I'm all in with England. For me, England will always come first and if I can fit anything else in, then great, but from an injury point of view, I think it's more a case of where I can get things in and where it makes sense. If they want me (for the Tests against Pakistan), I'll be ready to go,\" said Wood.\nWood finished with figures of 3 for 25 in his quota of four overs as England went 2-1 up in the T20I series.\nThe fast bowler also said he grew up watching Pakistan legends Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram, and values their opinion.\n\"They are guys I grew up watching. I look up to them a bit, so if they give you any praise, you know you must be doing something right. I value their opinion,\" Wood added.\nThe English fast bowler also credited Pakistan's ability to produce top international pacers, saying Pakistani pacers have a mystery about them that makes them deadly.\n\"It seems like this country produces a lot of fast bowlers and when you look at the pitches, their skill level has to be really high to get wickets and they've got that deadly pace as well. They have a mystery about them that makes them deadly,\" said Wood.\nEngland are currently in Pakistan for the seven-match T20I series as a part of their preparation for the T20 World Cup, which is due to begin Down Under on Oct. 16. The final T20I is on Oct. 7 and after which, they'll fly directly to Australia for the marquee tournament. \nLast year, England and Pakistan were among the semi-finalists in the T20 World Cup, but they ended up losing to New Zealand and Australia respectively. \nAfter the T20 World Cup, England's Test side will fly down to Pakistan for a three-match Test series, starting from Dec. 1.

Wonderful performance by the ladies.

So, it's good to see the Indian team doing so well in England,\" said Karim on 'Sports Over The Top' show on Sports18. \n \nHarmanpreet arrived at the crease when India were 99/3 in 19 overs. With youngster Harleen Deol (who made 58 off 72 balls) for company, Harmanpreet went about the rebuilding job. She got her fifty in 64 balls, sharing a 113-run stand for the fourth wicket with Harleen. \n \nAfter that, Harmanpreet accelerated brilliantly, getting her next 50 runs in 36 balls. She went on to score her last 43 runs off just 11 balls as India took a whopping 62 off the last three overs. Harmanpreet also shared an unbeaten 71-run stand off just 24 balls with Deepti Sharma to bat England completely out of the match. \n \nHighlighting the performance of Harleen and left-handed batter Yastika Bhatia, who made a fifty in the first game where vice-captain Smriti Mandhana top-scored with 91, Karim spoke on how India has improved their performance over time. \"Yes, and the others are learning from them. You see Harleen Deol putting some runs on the board. In the previous match, Yastika Bhatia who came to bat at number three, she's doing very well.\" \n \n\"I think both these batters, Harman and Smriti Mandhana can bat with more freedom and they can express themselves in the freedom that they are others who are backing them, that is something that is happening right now.\" \n \n\"The gradual improvement in performance from the other batters in the lineup, in addition to Harmanpreet and Smriti Mandhana, speaks volumes of the kind of effort these girls have made in the preparation and now the execution of the game plan,\" signed off Karim.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/heartening-to-see-harmanpreet-bat-with-far-more-freedom-saba-karim-762832"},

He has a serious back condition. It's a stress fracture and he could be out for a period of six months,\" a senior BCCI official told PTI on conditions of anonymity. Stress fracture is a tiny crack in the bone, caused by overuse and is common in sports persons. When stress reaction (bone bruise) goes undetected for a considerable time, it develops into stress fracture. \nAlmost 50 per cent of sports injuries are caused by stress fractures. Back stress fractures do not require surgery but a lot of time to heal. Rest is best solution to treat stress fractures. It is understood that either Deepak Chahar or Mohammed Shami could replace Bumrah in the main squad. Both were named as stand-by players for the prestigious tournament by the BCCI. \nBumrah, who played the second and third T20 against Australia, had travelled with the team to Thiruvananthapuram for the series-opener against South Africa but left for Bengaluru to be at National Cricket Academy (NCA) for rehabilitation. \nThe 28-year-old fast bowler is the second senior star player to be ruled out after Ravindra Jadeja, who is recovering from a knee surgery. \nThe Indian team is already looking unsettled at the moment and Bumrah's injury has only compounded the woes for skipper Rohit Sharma and coach Rahul Dravid. \"Losing Bumrah and Jadeja will be huge for India. We didn't expect that things will pan out as they have. He was rested for the Asia Cup precisely to manage his workload management. Now it remains a question if he was even fit enough to play the Australia series,\" the senior official said. \nMany senior players have been given adequate rest, keeping in mind their workload. What is more interesting is the fact that Bumrah has played only five Tests, five ODIs and as many T20Is in 2022 apart from IPL games for Mumbai Indians. \n\"That's not a lot of cricket, considering that he was rested for Asia Cup, West Indies tour and also some of the bilateral cricket played in India. That's a lot of rest. \n\"As of now he is at the NCA and the rehab will be a long and arduous one. Yes, World T20 is important but he is still young and India's biggest bowling asset. You can't take risk with him,\" the official said. \nBumrah, who has a slinging action, puts a lot of pressure on his back during loading. Former West Indies pace bowling great Michael Holding had assessed that Bumrah was always a candidate for back injuries.

The former World No. 1 player has not played a professional game since his quarter-final loss at Wimbledon in 2021. Following that, he had a surgery on his right knee, which was his third surgery in a span of just one and a half years. \nAhead of the Laver Cup, Federer has confirmed that he will not be playing a singles match and has convinced his Team Europe captain Bjorn Borg that he will be playing just one doubles game. \nIn a press conference on Wednesday at London's O2 Arena, his final one as an active player, Federer told reporters that he is hoping to be fit enough to play that one final game before bowing out of the sport he has been associated with for over two decades. \n\"I know my limitations, and this is why I asked Bjorn [Borg, the Europe captain] if it's OK that I play just one doubles. I guess that one would have to be Friday night. So here I am, trying to prepare for one last doubles. We'll see how it is. I am nervous because I haven't played for so long. I hope it goes well,\" said Federer.\nHis final press conference as an active player \ud83e\udd79\n | \n \nTo fit in Federer's request of just one doubles game, Laver Cup will have to tweak the rules. The competition, which is between Europe and the rest of the world, requires players usually to play at least one singles and one doubles fixture. Therefore, Italy's Matteo Berrettini will replace Federer on Saturday and Sunday.\nFederer went on to say that if he does play the final game of his career alongside Nadal, his longtime rival and friend, it would be a \"unique situation.\"\n\"Of course, no doubt. I think it could be quite a unique situation if it were to happen. For as long as we battled together, having had always this respect for one another, our families, coaching teams, for us as well to go through a career we both have had, come out the other side and have a nice relationship, is maybe a great message to tennis and beyond.\n\"For that reason, it would be great, I don't know if it will happen, but it would be great,\" the 41-year-old added further.\nAt Wimbledon this year, Federer, who has won a record eight singles titles at All England Club, received a standing ovation at an event to mark the centenary of Centre Court. While the Swiss superstar had hoped to return to the tournament one more time before calling it quits, a scan on the right knee that underwent surgery last summer was not very positive. \nHowever, Federer said he was most proud of his longevity and how he had managed to play at the top of the game. \n\"I was famous for being quite erratic at the beginning of my career.

{"title": "Former Barcelona star Dani Alves makes a surprising confession: 'I love Cristiano Ronaldo'", "date": "24 Sep 2022 6:12 PM GMT ", "description": "In a surprise confession, former FC Barcelona defender Danil Alves has said he \"loves\" Cristiano Ronaldo and he relates with the Portuguese forward more than he does with Lionel Messi.\nAlves, who moved from Sevilla to Barcelona in the summer of 2008, spent eight seasons at Camp Nou, where he would have come face to face against then-Real Madrid forward Ronaldo on many occasions. \nNow that both Alves and Ronaldo are not in their respective Spanish clubs, the Brazilian right-back feels freer to talk about his time in La Liga and his battles with Ronaldo. \n\"I love Cristiano. Now we're no longer at Barca or Madrid, I can speak, as it always seemed like I couldn't\", Alves said in a podcast. \nAlves, who now plays for a Mexican club Club Universidad Nacional, A.C (UNAM), said that Ronaldo demonstrates that hard-work pays off as he exemplifies hard-work over talent. The 39-year-old Alves went on to add that he has the utmost respect for the five-time Ballon d'Or winner. \n\"Cristiano exemplifies, for all of us who don't have that much quality, that with hard work, you can compete against the best. I respect him a lot and I had the opportunity to tell him,\" added Alves.\nAlves, who returned to Barcelona for a short second-stint last season, said that he was more similar to Ronaldo than his 'born talent' Barcelona teammate Messi. \n\"I identify with him, because everything I did in my life was based on work. As a player, I'm closer to Cristiano than Messi, because of work, not because of talent. Leo is a born talent, at a level only he can achieve,\" said Alves.\nThe Brazil national also revealed a scuffle he had with Ronaldo in a Ballon d'Or ceremony a few years ago when he was a Barcelona player and Ronaldo was at Real Madrid. \n\"There was a time, because of the rivalry, I went to greet him and he ignored me. There was a controversy that never came out but in the Ballon d'Or dressing room we had a scuffle. I greeted everyone and he ignored me because of the Barca-Madrid rivalry,\" Alves added.\nRonaldo moved from Juventus to Manchester United in the summer of 2021. He was the Red Devils' leading goal scorer last season with 24 goals. But it was not enough to help his side finish in the top four of the Premier League. As a result, Manchester United have dropped to the second-tier European competition, Europa League. \nAfter leaving Barcelona in 2016, Alves had a brief stint with Juventus before he moved to Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) for two seasons. He then played for Sao Paulo for three years. \nMeanwhile, Alves is now aiming to seal a spot in Brazil's squad for the FIFA World Cup, which is due to be played in Qatar in November-December. Alves is also looking to go past Real Madrid legend Roberto Carlos as Brazil's second most capped player of all time.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/former-barcelona-star-dani-alves-makes-a-surprising-confession-i-love-cristiano-ronaldo-762959"},

The result, which did not end in the legendary pair's favour, did not matter at all as the occasion was the bigger factor. \nWhen the match and, with it, Federer's time in professional tennis ended as well. He hugged Nadal, then their opponents Frances Tiafoe and Jack Sock of Team World. And then Federer began crying. \nThere were plenty of tears around, with Stefanos Tsitsipas, Novak Djokovic, and Taylor Fritz among others seen wiping away their tears, the player who stood out was Nadal, who cried inconsolably, along with Federer. The picture of the two arch-rivals sitting on the bench, holding hands, and crying has gone rival.\nTHIS. \ud83e\udef6\ud83e\udd79 \nFederer and Nadal have given the sports fraternity some emotional scenes to remember for life.\n\"When Roger leaves the tour, an important part of my life is leaving, too,\" the 36-year-old Nadal said, who used the words \"sad\" and \"unforgettable\" to describe the occasion.\n\"I was shaking a little bit. Has been a difficult day to handle every single thing and in the end, everything became super emotional. For me, it has been a huge honour to be a part of this amazing moment in the history of our sport and at the same time a lot of years sharing a lot of things together. On court, we have completely opposite styles and that's what probably makes our matches and our rivalry probably one of the biggest and most interesting,\" said Nadal after the match at O2 Arena in London. \nThe Spaniard went on to add that in he and Federer have a similar approach in their respective personal lives and that's why they trust each other so much. \n\"But in the family life, personal life, probably we approach life not in a very different way, no? So that's why we can trust each other, we can speak very often and we're able to speak very feeling free, feeling confident. Having somebody like Roger that I feel confident to talk about any personal thing, it's something that is very beautiful after all the things that we shared together and all the important things that we fought for such a long time,\" said Nadal.\nThe Fedal bromance is everything. \ud83e\udef6\n x \n \nMeanwhile, the 41-year-old Federer said his journey as a professional tennis player was \"perfect\"\" and he \"would do it all over again.\"\nAfter Federer was congratulated by all the players of Team Europe and Team World, he met his wife, Mirka, their four children (twin girls and twin boys) \u2013 Leo, Lenny, Myla and Charlene, and parents Lynette and Robert\u2014for embraces and, yes, more crying. Members of both teams joined together to carry Federer up in the air.\n\"... to be saying goodbye on a team, I always felt I was a team player at heart. Singles doesn't really do that but I've had a team that travelled with me around the world. It's been amazing with them, so thanks to everybody who made it work for so many years.\" \n \n\"It's been a wonderful day. I told the guys I'm happy; I'm not sad. I enjoyed tying my shoes one more time. Everything was the last time.\"\nFederer was emotional during his on-court interview, where he paid tribute to his wife Mirka. \"She could have stopped me a long, long time ago but she didn't. She kept me going and allowed me to play, so it's amazing - thank you,\" the former World No. 1 said.\nFederer also acknowledged the crucial role his mother played in his career. \"I find it always funny - we always blame my Mum for everything because, without her, I would not be here, of course. So, thanks to my parents, you have been amazing,\" added Federer. \nLast week, Federer announced his retirement and confirmed that Laver Cup would be his final tournament as an active player. The 20-time Grand Slam champion had a succession of operations during the last two and a half years on his right knee that eventually proved unsuccessful. \nIt meant Federer's last singles appearance was his quarter-final defeat to Hubert Hurkacz at Wimbledon 2021.\nFederer finished his competitive tennis career with 20 Grand Slam singles titles. His trophy cabinet includes six Australian Open titles, one French Open trophy, a record eight Wimbledon trophies and five consecutive US Open titles (2004-2008). His ATP career has ended with 1,251 wins, which is the second-most after Jimmy Connors (1,274).

After hopping and fending on his first ball, Suryakumar slammed back-to-back sixes - a top-edge on pull went over third man and a nonchalant flick went over backward square leg. \nRahul, who was kept quiet by a slew of outswingers and inswingers apart from surviving close lbw shouts off Parnell and Rabada, opened up by flicking off his wrists over long-on for six off Nortje, followed by Suryakumar slapping through point for four off Keshav Maharaj.\nRahul then pulled Tabraiz Shamsi over backward square leg for six and Suryakumar ended the over by flicking hard off his wrists through deep mid-wicket for four. Suryakumar enthralled the crowd with his trademark shot when he lofted inside-out with the turn over wide long-off off Maharaj. \nA pacy full toss from Nortje was lofted over cover by Rahul for six while Suryakumar placed a slower ball through point for four as India started to coast towards victory. \nSuryakumar continued to collect fours with ease against Rabada and reached his second consecutive fifty in 33 balls in the next over.

Bumrah featured only in the second and third T20Is against Australia, where he managed just one wicket. Harshal, who played all the three T20Is, also bagged just one scalp. \nThanks to Suryakumar Yadav and Virat Kohli's third-wicket partnership of 104 runs, India successfully chased down Australia's target of 187 in the third T20I on Sunday in Hyderabad. With that, Rohit and Co sealed the three-match T20I series 2-1. \nRohit, who struck a six and two fours in his knock of 14-ball 17, called Hyderabad a \"special place.\"\n\"It's a special place. We have had great memories playing for India and when I played for Deccan Chargers as well. The biggest positive was different individuals stepping up and delivering. You feel good about it as management,\" said Rohit. \nThe Indian skipper also pointed out that the margin of error in T20 cricket is small but his side was brave enough to take their chances against world champions Australia in the third T20I. \n\"Margin of error in T20s is small. We took our chances, we were brave as well. Sometime it doesn't come off. There are areas to improve as well. Not easy coming back after a break against a tough team. They (Bumrah and Harshal) will take some time. Hopefully they can get back into their groove in the next series,\" the Indian skipper added further. \nAxar Patel, who has been selected for the T20 World Cup in place of Ravindra Jadeja, had a fantastic series against Australia. He was named the Player of the Series for finishing the series with eight wickets in three games. The next best bowler was Australia's Nathan Ellis with three wickets. \n\"When you do well and the team wins the series, it feels great. I try to back myself with the line and lengths I bowl and even if the batter takes me on I back myself,\" said Axar after receiving the PoS award on Sunday. \nKohli and Surya scored a half-century each and played vital roles in India's win on Sunday. \nBut it was the Mumbai batsman who stole the show yet again with his strike rate of close to 200 as he struck five sixes and five fours in his 36-ball 69. Kohli, meanwhile, scored a 48-ball 63. Surya was named the Player of the Match for his half-century, which was his seventh fifty in the T20Is for India.\n\"In that situation, I thought let me take my chance. I had two-three shots in mind but I tried to hit over mid-off only. My mindset is pretty clear. Loving it at No. 4. There will be a tough challenge but you got to express yourself and be a little smart as well,\" said Surya.\nCHAMPIONS \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\ud83d\udc99 \nSurya also received praises from Kohli, who said the No. 4 batsman has \"got the gift of timing.\"\n\"He [Surya] has the game to bat under any sort of situation and any condition. He has shown that already. He got a hundred in England, he batted beautifully in the Asia Cup. Here, he's striking the ball as well as I have seen him strike. For the past six months, he's been outstanding. It's the array of shots and to play those shots at the right time is such a tremendous skill. He's a guy who knows his game inside out. He's got the gift of timing and I was in awe watching him play his shots,\" Kohli said of Surya on Sunday.\nMeanwhile, Australia captain Aaron Finch admitted that his side was \"sloppy\" with bat and ball at times. \n\"It was a really good series. The way we fought back was fantastic. Really with a young player like Green have such an impact. We had to get wickets, can't beat India by containing.

India won the three-match series 2-1. Cameron Green (52) scored upfront while Tim David (54) provided the final flourish as Australia posted 186 for six after being invited to bat. \nWith the pitch offering grip and turn, Axar Patel (3/33) picked three wickets, while also executing a sensational run out. \nYuzvendra Chahal (1/22) was also in his element, bowling an economical spell. Chasing 187, India didn't have the best of starts as openers KL Rahul (1) and Rohit Sharma (17) were out inside the first four overs. But Kohli and Suryakumar batted with authority, hitting boundaries and sixes at regular intervals to keep the required run rate in check as Australian bowlers struggled to find answers. \nWhile Suryakumar orchestrated the carnage, Kohli played the second fiddle. At the halfway mark India needed 96 with eight wickets in hand. Suryakumar soon brought his fifty as the duo plundered 15 off Adam Zampa's 13th over. Australia fashioned a comeback, ending Suryakumar's outstanding innings with India needing 53 off the last six overs. \nKohli, however, continued to go about his business, whacking Pat Cummins for a six in the very next over. He brought his first fifty of the series in 36 balls. Australia bowled some tight overs to keep themselves in the hunt. But Hardik (25 not out) and Kohli slammed a couple of sixes but the latter was out leaving India in need of five runs from four balls. \nEarlier, Green was on the offensive from the start. He smashed the second delivery to square leg for a massive six, which was followed by a boundary as Australia collected 12 off the first over after being asked to bat. Green continued the onslaught, smashing Jasprit Bumrah (0/50) for a four before hitting back-to-back sixes, including one that went to the second tier much to the dismay of the partisan crowd. \nWith Australia going over 13 runs per over, Axar provided the home side with the first breakthrough as he bowled a slower one, forcing Aaron Finch (7) to mistime the shot with Hardik collecting the ball at mid-on. Green brought his 50 in 19 balls in the fifth over, his innings studded with seven fours and three sixes. But the opener was soon sent packing by Bhuvneshwar Kumar (1/39), who bowled slightly wide only for the Australian to slash the ball to KL Rahul. \nAustralia plundered 66 runs for the loss off two wickets from the Powerplay. But Glenn Maxwell's (6) woeful run continued as Axar executed a brilliant run out with a direct hit from the boundary. There was some doubt whether it was a run-out as wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik's glove had knocked out one bail but in the end the decision went in India's favour. Just before the halfway mark Karthik stumped Smith (8) who was deceived by Chahal's wrong 'un as the Australian innings seemed to fall apart. But Josh Inglis (24) and David steadied the Australian innings as the visitors made a comeback. \nSkipper Rohit Sharma introduced Harshal Patel (1/18) in the 13th over but his struggles continued. The medium pacer was first hit for six, which was followed by a no-ball and a wide. Rohit then brought Axar back into the attack and the left-armer immediately repaid the skipper's faith by getting rid off Inglis and danger-man Matthew Wade. The strapping David slammed two consecutive sixes and a four off Bhuvneshwar, who missed his length in the 18th over.

However, he now is looking forward to touring India for the ODI and \n. The three-match T20I series will go underway on Sept. 28 in Thiruvananthapuram and the three-ODI series will begin on Oct. 6 in Delhi. \nThe Proteas side spent some time in Cape Town for a team-building exercise before leaving the country. \nBavuma-led South Africa will directly head to Australia from India for the \n. South Africa's group in the marquee event also includes India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and the qualifying team from Group 2. \nIn a press conference, before leaving for India, Bavuma said their immediate aim is to have everyone touch their form ahead of the T20 World Cup. \n\"We want to get the guys into form, most of them have been in form but guys like me, I've been out of action for the past three months so now I'm looking forward to that. Personally, I just want to be out there on the park and using that opportunity to get game time, to get runs behind me and to get the confidence back. \n\"There may be other guys as well not yet in the right form, so it's about getting them to where they need to be at. We also need to finalise that final XI. We have a good idea of what that team will look like, but also considering the fact that conditions in India are different to those in Australia. So the side we probably play in Australia won't necessarily be the one in India,\" added Bavuma in the departure press conference.\nSpeaking of his injuries that led him to miss the T20I against Ireland and England, Bavuma said, \"The last few months have been the toughest from an injury point of view,\" he explained. \"It was definitely frustrating. \n\"Going through that period not really knowing when I was going to recover with my elbow, it was quite difficult mentally. But I'm here now, by elbow feels good, I obviously opted against the surgery, but I'm excited and blessed to have the opportunity again to run out there for the Proteas.\" \nMark Boucher is set to step down as South Africa's head coach at the end of the T20 World Cup. When reporters asked Bavuma if the team's brand of cricket would change once Boucher departs, the skipper replied,\" It's difficult to look that far into the future. We're just focussed on the now at the moment and that is on the tour to India. \nThe focus is also on filling the gaps that need to be filled in terms of preparation, also in terms of getting the guys into form leading up to the World Cup and making sure we keep holding on to our confidence and belief as a unit. That's where the focus is right now.\" \nIn fact, Bavuma sees Boucher's departure as extra motivation for his side to do well in the ICC event, which is due to begin on Oct. 16 Down Under. \n\"We obviously have the situation of the coach who will be leaving the team after the World Cup and I guess that's an extra bit of motivation for us as a unit with everything that is already there. \n\"What happens after the World Cup is quite hard to talk about. In terms of the brand of play, I don't see that changing. I think the language that we've been speaking as a team has been quite consistent over the last 18 months, so I don't see that changing. The coach will leave, but his taste and brand on the team that is with us at the moment will continue.\"", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/ind-vs-sa-injury-lay-off-was-difficult-mentally-says-temba-bavuma-ahead-of-t20i-series-762846"},

After failing to score an international century for nearly three years, Kohli ended the drought in the recently concluded Asia Cup. He scored an unbeaten 122 against Afghanistan, which was also his maiden T20I hundred. \nFinch also said that it would take a very brave man to write Kohli off on any given day considering what the Indian star has achieved in the last 15 years.\n''It would be a very brave man to write Virat Kohli off. At any stage, he has shown for 15 years now that he is one of the greatest players of all time,'' Finch told reporters ahead of the first T20I against India.\n''Particularly in T20 cricket, he's someone who has developed and grown his game over such a long period that you always plan and prepare the best when you're coming up against him. He is super and has 71 international centuries. That's just ridiculous,'' added Finch in the same conference.\nFinch, who has been struggling with the bat for some time now, recently announced retirement from ODIs. Australia's three-match ODI series against New Zealand at home was Finch's final in the 50-over format for Australia. While the hosts clinched the series 3-0, Finch managed just 10 runs, including a duck in the second game. \n\"Over a long period of time, you get pretty comfortable with criticism, but in T20 cricket, I feel my form has been really good for quite a while now. I think if you separate the ODI form and the T20 form, then they're totally different, they're two different formats of the game. 'Every decision that we make, I think, has one eye towards the World Cup and seeing the wicket yesterday, it looked like there was quite a bit of grass on it.\n''And we know in Mohali, the ball can swing around and it can carry through quite a bit, so I think we will be mindful of not being too narrow-minded in terms of our focus. 'What we've tried to do over the last sort of six-eight-ten months is make sure that everything that we're doing in the T20 space ties back into the World Cup and, for us, it's about making sure that once we get there that we've had plenty of different combinations of teams that we can play,'' added Finch. \nIn the lead-up to the T20 World Cup, which is scheduled to begin on Oct. 16 in Australia, Finch and Co have toured India for a three-match T20I series.

However, Finch insisted that the all-rounder's display at No. 4 in the PSG influenced the Aussies' decision. \n\"What Tim brings to the table obviously is some great form in competitions around the world. In various batting positions I know in the PSL, he batted at 4 and had a great tournament, other tournaments, he batted five and six. So we see him as a really versatile and flexible player and obviously his power speaks for itself,\" said Finch ahead of the third decisive T20I.\nFinch also reckoned that David could be more suitable at the back end of the innings, at No. 6, which would aid Australia in the death overs of a game. \n\"We've all seen how destructive he can be once he gets in and in terms of the order I think it just depends on the game situation, maybe, some matchups in the opposition as well. Ideally, it'd be right towards the back end because the top order has done a great job.\n\"But I think if you look down our World Cup squad, we've got some power there with Maxwell, Stoinis, David, Wade and Smith. We've got a lot of options there which is really good,\" the Australian captain added further. \nAfter losing the opening game in Mohali, Rohit Sharma and Co levelled the series 1-1 in Nagpur. The third and final game of the series is scheduled to take place on Sunday (Sept. 26) in Hyderabad. \n\"It's important that you're always looking at ways to improve and obviously we were with Maxwell at three, Tim David at four.

Josh Inglis came out at the last minute, and Sean Abbott took his spot. That was just to give us an extra bowling option, not knowing how the wicket would play.\n\"So there's just a little bit of execution with bat and ball I think at times that probably just swung the momentum of the game.

{"title": "IND vs AUS: Suryakumar 'knows his game inside out,' says Kohli after India win T20I series against Australia", "date": "25 Sep 2022 6:51 PM GMT ", "description": "Virat Kohli has heaped praise on Suryakumar Yadav, saying the middle-order batsman \"knows his game inside out\".\nKohli's comments came on Sunday after Surya played a match-winning knock of 69 to help India defeat Australia by six wickets in the third T20I. With that, India also claimed the T20I series 2-1. \nDuring India's chase of 187 in the decisive third T20I in Hyderabad, Kohli and Surya put up 104 runs for the third wicket and scored a half-century each. Surya stole the show yet again with his strike rate of close to 200 as he struck five sixes and five fours in his 36-ball 69. Kohli, meanwhile, scored a 48-ball 63, including four sixes and three fours. \nSpeaking at the post-match presentation, Kohli said that Surya has the \"clarity in what he wants to do.\"\n\"He [Surya] has the game to bat under any sort of situation and any condition. He has shown that already. He got a hundred in England, he batted beautifully in the Asia Cup. Here, he's striking the ball as well as I have seen him strike. For the past six months, he's been outstanding. It's the array of shots and to play those shots at the right time is such a tremendous skill. He's a guy who knows his game inside out. He's got the gift of timing and I was in awe watching him play his shots,\" Kohli said of Surya on Sunday. \nSurya was named the Player of the Match for his half-century, which was his seventh fifty in the T20Is for India.\nBrilliant character shown by the boys to seal the series after being down. \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 \nWhen Kohli was asked about his batting, the former Indian skipper said he has been batting at No. 3 because he wants to \"utilise\" his experience and wants to keep contributing and doing what is best for the team. \n\"That's why I'm batting at 3, I have to utilise my experience and give the team what the team wants. I got off to a good start then I had to take down Zampa because he's an important bowler through the middle. When Surya started hitting it like that, I kinda looked at the dug-out as well. Rohit and Rahul bhai both told me, 'you can just keep batting on' because Surya was striking it that well. It was just about building a partnership. I just used my experience a little bit,\" said Kohli after India's win.\nIn the last game, Australian spinner Adam Zampa dismissed Kohli, which marked the eighth time the Indian batsman got out to this particular player. Zampa now holds the record for dismissing Kohli for the most number of times for an Australian.\nKohli went on to add that he had already decided to go after Zampa, who has always tried to control the former's scoring rate. \n\"I kind of made up my mind to go after him [Adam Zampa] today. He's a quality bowler and he tries to control my scoring rate whenever we play and I knew that he was going to attack the stumps, so I was standing outside leg already. Last game I was a bit disappointed that after hitting him for a four, I went for a double rather than hitting him for a six,\" said Kohli. \nThe former Indian captain, who had been struggling to score runs for a while now, earlier took a month's break to regroup himself. Following that, Kohli ended his three-year wait and recorded his 71st international century. It came in Asia Cup 2022 against Afghanistan and it was also his maiden T20I hundred.\n\"I'm making a conscious effort to strike those big ones through the middle overs so that it can help the team situation. The game shouldn't have gone on that long, we should have probably had 4 or 5 to chase in the final over. It was important to maintain my composure and get one boundary (on that first-ball six in the 20th over). I'm happy with my contribution to the team, I took a break, went back to the nets, worked hard on my fitness and think it's coming off well. I want to keep contributing and doing my best for the team,\" Kohli said further.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/sports/cricket/ind-vs-aus-suryakumar-knows-his-game-inside-out-says-kohli-after-india-win-t20i-series-against-australia-763111"},

According to industry sources, 1.75 lakh power looms in these two districts are shut due to the strike.\nWhen contacted, the president of the power loom unit weavers in Coimbatore and Tiruppur, C. Palaniswamy said, \"The strike has today entered the fourth day and this has led to a loss of Rs 35 crore per day. The production of 1 crore meter length of fabric has also been affected due to the strike.\"\nTwo lakh workers are directly employed and another three lakh are indirectly employed in the power looms spread across Palladam and Somannur areas of the two districts where the maximum concentration of units are present.\nThe workers are in doldrums as almost all of these workers do not know any other profession. They had conducted a strike in January for a hike in wages, but the strike was called off in March. The increase in cotton and yarn prices since May has also put a break on the production of cloth from power looms. The present strike will also directly affect the workers as shutting down the power looms means no jobs and hence no money.\nShanmuganathan T., a power loom weaver from Palladam while speaking to IANS said, \"I am not sure when the strike will come to an end. We had strikes for wage hikes in January 2022 and continued for two months before it was called off in March. The power looms were closed due to increase in prices of cotton and yarn and with the power tariff hike, there is again a shutdown. All these are directly affecting the workers and we don't know what to do else as we have been trained for this only.\"\nHe said that the new power tariff hike will put a higher burden of Rs 8,000 - Rs 9,000 on each power loom unit per month which is a major increase as far as power loom weavers are concerned.\nThe power loom weavers also demand that the increase in fixed charges above 750 units of power for a unit was also creating a burden on them.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/tamilnadu/tn-power-loom-weavers-strike-enters-4th-day-rs-35-cr-daily-loss-762280"},

This year once again the rousing beats of dhak at the puja pandals have attracted the attention of devotees. 'Dhakis' (drummers) are specially brought from West Bengal to drum up the ecstatic beats of joy. Many devotees specially come to listen to the drum sounds.\nAccording to the Bengali Durga Puja Committees, the Dhakis, who are the most integral part of the pujas, have to be hired from West Bengal as there are no traditional drummers in the city. The art of playing the huge barrel-shaped membranophone instrument is considered as staple of Durga Puja. \nEvery puja ritual has a different and unique tune and beat of the dhak right from the arrival of the idols till their immersion. It is played when the idol enters the pandal and even when the goddess exits on the last day of puja, Dashami (Dasara). On the tenth day, the melodious beats of the dhak help to uplift the air of sadness and gloom during the vermilion ritual (sindur khela) and ultimately, the immersion. In West Bengal, the drummers hardly earn during puja; they earn Rs 5,000 a day here. \nMithun Sabdakar, a drummer from Cooch Behar (WB), who has been playing drums for the past 10 years in the city, said \"I and my team look forward to this occasion every year, as we get the opportunity to visit Hyderabad and showcase our talent. Only during the Durga Puja and Kali Puja can we showcase our talent and earn money. Rest of the months we are forced to do some odd jobs. For the past ten years, I have been coming to Hyderabad and playing drums at the Hyderabad Bangalee Samity (HBS) which hosts the oldest puja in the city.\" \n\"I and my team consist of 10 traditional drummers who love to come to the city every year during the puja. We feel the atmosphere here is like our home town. For the past 15 years, I have been coming to the city along with my team to play the dhak. While playing drums I get pleasant happiness. Apart from Hyderabad, I have played drums in Nagaland, Mumbai and Jaipur,\" said Duldal Das, the drummer from Murshidabad (WB), who has been a drummer for the past 15 years in Bangiya Sanskritik Sangha, Keyes High school, Secunderabad. \n \"Compared to West Bengal, over here the Dhakis receive respect. They are paid well. Only in this puja months we can earn. Rest of the year we do odd jobs to run our family,\" said Nando Das, another drummer from Murshidabad. \"Apart from Bhog and cultural programmes, no Durga puja is complete without dhaki. Every year we specially come to puja pandals, to listen to Dhaki beat, as there are mesmerising,\" said Ramesh Kundu, IT employee. \n\"Every we wait for Durga puja, specially on Dashami, as I love to see drummers perform, as their style is unique,\" said Anu Das, home-maker.

He also inaugurated and laid the foundation stone of multiple projects in Bilaspur town, the hometown of BJP President J.P. Nadda. \nThe Kullu Dussehra festival concludes with the 'Lanka Dahan' ritual on the banks of the Beas river. All the assembled deities will participate, before they are carried back to their own temples in a beautifully decorated palanquin. \nThe festival traces its origin to 1637 when Raja Jagat Singh ruled Kullu. He had invited all local deities in Kullu to perform a ritual in honour of Lord Raghunath during Dussehra. Since then, the annual assembly of deities from hundreds of village temples has become a tradition. \nAfter the abolition of the Indian princely states, the district administration has been inviting the deities. \nAccording to a reference book compiled by the Kullu administration, there are 534 'living' gods and goddesses in the Kullu Valley, which is popularly known also as Devbhoomi or abode of gods. \n\"Here, 'devtas' or gods command and the people obey. The gods here are not idols and enshrined in the temples; they are alive,\" says the 583-page book compiled after a year-long research and field work. \nThe gods \"live\" among the people and \"speak\" to their followers and tell them what to do. They have families and relatives who join them in celebrations. \nThe book says the affairs of the Kullu gods are managed by the 'devta' committees that comprise a 'kardar' or manager of the temple, the 'gur' or oracle, musicians and a priest. It says every year over 250 gods and goddesses assembled for the Kullu Dussehra. \nThe gods accept invites of their followers and move to various locations as per their wish, says the book. Sometimes they decide to undertake a pilgrimage. Some do so after one-two years, others do so after 30 to 40 years and some embark on special pilgrimage after hundreds of years. \nThe 'devta' summons the 'gur' and speaks through him. The oracle goes into a trance and connects with the deity. The deity's wish spreads and its followers are ready to obey the sacred command. \nOne member of each family has to join the deity's procession. No one can lift the 'rath' or palanquin of the deity if he/she is not willing. \nThe book says the long and tough journeys are to be performed on foot. It takes days, even months. Strict rules and rituals have to be followed. The deity sets the time and pace of the journey.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/news/national/modi-becomes-first-pm-to-attend-kullu-dussehra-764327"},

Ghana, Namibia, Sudan, and Zambia. The technologies include Ground Water Level Measuring Device and Ergonomically Designed Treadle Pump. \nAccording to the institute, the said technologies transferred to the four African countries are the improved versions over the practices followed by the rural people in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, respectively. The first technology, i.e. groundwater level measurement device is used to measure the groundwater table in monitoring wells. The device consists of a robust rust-resistant stainless-steel probe connected to a high-tension coaxial cable. The cable is then connected to an electronic circuit containing a battery, an LED lamp, and a buzzer. \nTo measure the groundwater, a probe is lowered into the well, and as it comes in contact with water, the circuit is completed, the buzzer beeps, and the LED glows. The individual operating the mechanism can then get the depth using the markings on the cord. \nWhile the first technology focuses on measuring the ground water level, the second technology i.e., Treadle pump is a mechanical device that uses human power to draw water from the ground. It is a twin-cylinder reciprocating water pump presently being used by poor/marginal farmers in various places for irrigation purposes. The said technology, however, can be utilised to extract water from the depth of the water level of around 10 m or less. RuTAG has claimed that an average person can draw water at a rate of 3500 to 4000 litres per hour. The treadle pump parts are made of mild steel, and the estimated life of the pump is around 10 to 15 years. \nProf S.K. Saha, Coordinationar, RuTAG, IIT Delhi, said, \"It is a proud moment for RuTAG IIT Delhi to go global. More importantly, such knowledge sharing that would benefit the major percentage of the World population is a great satisfaction as a technologist. IIT Delhi is committed to expand and support such knowledge sharing in the days to come\".", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/news/national/iit-delhis-rutag-transfers-two-groundwater-technologies-to-4-african-countries-764097"},

After absconding, the accused who has two children started working in a small lock-making factory of Dilshad in Aligarh. Earlier, he used to work in a suitcase shop in the Sadar Bazar area of Delhi.

He helped the then DCP and ACP in pacifying the crowd and controlling it as the situation started heating up.

Then, he started pointing out the good and bad elements of the remaining contestants starting with Faima. He questioned her why did she cheat Revanth? Although she tried to give an explanation, Nag was not satisfied and said that Revanth made her win even though she cheated him. He also said that she didn't give her 100% this week in the game.\nNext in the line is Chanti, Nag said that his comedy is fine and asked him why didn't he take the captaincy challenge serious and warned him to play the game or else he will be out of the house.\nThereafter he called out RJ Surya and asked him that you do a lot of work outside but why are you chilling here?\nNext comes singer Revanth\u2026 First, he praised him for controlling his anger but asked him to stop correcting everyone in the house. \nThen he asked Neha did she give her 100% in the game being a sports person. But she said that due to her pain she couldn't move fast in the game.\nThen he also said to Arohi that he will only score her 50 marks out of 100 although she scored herself 70. He asked her to use her brain and stop targeting Arjun.\nHere comes Geethu Royal\u2026 She is only the person who was appreciated by the host. He gave her full marks and asked her to play in the same way.\nHe also advised Inaya to play the game and don't think about support. Finally, he also took a class to new captain Raj as he begged everyone to him a chance for this week. Nag said that one should become a captain with their game not with self-sympathy.\nThen, he turned his side to the nine people who are made to stand behind the sofa. He started off with Kirti and said that she should come out of her pain and start playing the game to win her life. He said, \"You haven't played anything this week.\"\nNext, he said Sri Satya had nothing to do this week as she also didn't take the game seriously by stating that she is not ready to take the captaincy this week in the starting itself. Her concentration was only on the meal than the toy! He asked her to take the game seriously and warned her!\nNext comes power couple Marina Rohit\u2026 Nagarjuna asked them to play together and put out their strategies without worrying about the housemates' comments as they came with dual power and are not using it! \nIn the same way, he also scolded Srihan and asked him to concentrate on the game rather than wasting the time concentrating on his looks. \nEven boss lady Abhinaya is also scolded by Nagarjuna\u2026 He asked her whether it's the right way to be in the house and that too after stating it as her second innings. \nHe asked Shani why he stepped into the house. Is it to sleep, eat and enjoy? He asked him to stop being too good and play the game by raising his voice. He also asked him why he stopped playing the game in the middle even though other contestants are continuing it.\nNag also warned Vasanti to play the game instead of sitting quietly in the house. \nFinally, he also scolded Bala Aditya and asked him to stop being good to the contestants and asked him to do only his work rather than helping others. \nSo, he asked the remaining contestants to vote for the worst performer of the week from these nine and said that one will be out from the show who bags the maximum votes. Shani, Vasanti and Sri Satya got 3 votes each but Nagarjuna evicted Shani saying that even the audience's decision is the same. \nShani was not even shown to the other contestants\u2026 He met Nagarjuna on the stage and bid him goodbye! But the small colourful element of the episode is Nagarjuna inviting his wife Amala who essayed a prominent role in Sharwanand's Oke Oka Jeevitham movie.\nSharwanand and Amala spoke about their movie and shared a few elements of the film with the audience on the stage!", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/cinema/tollywood/bigg-boss-telugu-6-saturday-episode-highlights-shani-gets-eliminated-from-the-house-762180"},

She is extremely talented. Pupul Jayakar was Mrs Indira Gandhi's childhood friend so my scenes are the ones where you get to see the non-political side of this great statesman and controversial political leader during the time of Emergency.

He is more interested in everyone's sex life than in his film scripts. He self admittedly buys reviews, stars, and fake collection numbers and tickets.

He brings about a change in naxalites and criminals but he has bigger hurdles to overcome. He even sacrifices his personal life for his police job. \nAlluri's is an inspirational journey, going by the trailer. Kayadu Lohar plays Sree Vishnu's wife in the film. \nPradeep Varma makes a good impression with his writing and taking. Raj Thota's camera work is neat and Harshavardhan Rameshwar strengthens the narrative with his captivating background score. It's evident through the trailer that Alluri is going to be a gripping police drama. \nThe film's pre-release event will be held at the N Convention in Hyderabad on September 18 with Allu Arjun gracing it as the chief guest. Dharmendra Kakarala and Vital are handling editing and art departments respectively. \n'Alluri', which will be releasing worldwide on September 23, has been produced by Bekkem Venugopal for Lucky Media and is being presented by Bekkem Babita.

{"title": "Sex Education Season 3: A super follow-up to the first two seasons", "date": "12 Oct 2021 7:50 PM GMT ", "description": "There is a major reason why Sex Education is a popular web series and is awaited by many. It is a series which juggled many delicate issues like teen sexuality, gender identity etc, and these things are dealt in such a way that you never feel like being lectured. Season 3 not only builds on the aspects of the first two ones but it goes even further. In a nutshell Sex Education 3 is a stimulating season that will meet the expectations of all the fans.\nFor those who haven't seen season 1 and 2 the series primarily followed the journey of Otis Milburn (Asa Butterfield). He is a student at Moordale Secondary school. Otis is slightly ambivalent towards sex. The major reason for that is his divorced mother Jean (Gillian Anderson). She is a sex therapist who has frequent affairs but is unable to maintain relationships. Otis best friend is Eric (Ncuti Gatwa). Eric is a gay son of Ghanaian- Nigerian immigrants. Over the course of the first season Otis becomes close with Maeve Wiley (Emma Mackey). She is a confidence student but her high intelligence is overshadowed by her troubled past. \nOther important characters at Moordale include Adam Groff (Connor Swindells). He is the headmaster's son who develops a bullying nature out of his own insecurity. Other important ones are a widowed plumber (Mikeal Persbrandt). Jakob and Jean start dating and that creates tensions in Otis life. Otis sets up a sex therapy business with Maeve in order to help their fellow students who have sexual problems. Their business becomes a success but conflict arises when Otis starts getting attracted to Maeve. \nApart from the romance aspect the second season had a number of new students at Moordale that challenged the status quo. You also had an outbreak called Chlamydia that caused students to question and struggle with topical issues. Also jean became pregnant with Jakob's baby. Another important thing which happens in the second season was the Eric and Adam relationship. \nSeason 3 begins off with Adam Groff's father Micheal Groff being replaced. The reason being Moordale has developed the reputation of being a sex school under his leadership. There is a new person leading the school and she is Hope Haddon. Hope Haddon is someone who takes the approach of Dolores Umbrige from book five of Harry Potter. She is someone who believes in lecturing and those who question her are punished. She enforces strict regulations. Some of these regulations are endorsing abstinence as a deterrent for unwanted pregnancies. Through all these methods Haddon is dismantling the social order of the school. \nThe biggest highlight of Season 3 just like the first two seasons is how it deals with the female characters. There are written with lot of insight. \nThis insight can be particularly seen with the characters of Maeve and also the pregnancy of Otis mother Jean Melbourn. The process of Jean and Jakob staying in one house and trying to make things work has been delicately handled by creator Laurie Nunn. There is also a book that Jean Melbourn is writing on sex education but at no point it comes across as uncomfortable. \nThe journey of Maeve is another strong point. Maeve is someone who is battling issues both romantically and also otherwise. But at no point we see her complaining, there is a grace with which she handles things that is missing in Otis. Lastly the arc of Hope Haddon is also something that engages you. The character could have easily become a uni- dimensional antagonist but it isn't. You get a sense of her battling her own demons. Through her character we see how success at her age comes with its own share of setbacks particularly if you are a woman. \nWith these three female characters points are made about women's rights, patriarchy and loving oneself. \nAn overreaching theme of Season 3 is the theme of friendship. This can be majorly seen in the bond between Otis and Erick, Aimee and Maeve. Through the bond of Eric and Otis the creators give a different spin on how male friendships are viewed in pop culture. There is a saying about how men don't generally talk about their sexual feelings about their significant ones but here both Otis and Eric never hide their feelings from each other and that is super endearing. Similarly the way Aimee and Maeve overcome their issues and hold each other is also nice to watch. \nThe performances of the major characters are spot on as usual but my favourite ones are Emma Mackey, Gillian Anderson and Ncuti Gatwa.

Nariman requested for an order of no coercive action against the cast and producers of the web series. However, the bench refused to grant relief. \"Approach High Court\" said the top court. \nDuring the hearing the apex court noted that it may consider the request for clubbing the FIRs, but it cannot take the power of the High Court under CrPC. \nThe observation was made after senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi requested the court to grant the petitioners no coercive step order, club the FIRS and issue notice to the parties. \nAhead of lunch, the top court had orally observed that freedom of speech was not absolute during its hearing on pleas seeking stay on FIRs against actors and producers of Tandav web series on Amazon Prime. Justice Bhushan had expressed its disinclination to pass any direction to stay the FIRs. Senior advocates Fali S. Nariman, Mukul Rohatgi and Siddharth Luthra cited the top court judgment in Arnab Goswami case to seek relief in the matter. \nLuthra argued that the director of the web series is being harassed. \"Is this way liberty should be protected in the country and FIRs are being filed across the country,\" he added. The bench observed that the right to freedom of speech is not absolute and it is subjected to restrictions. \nNariman submitted that apologies have been made, and despite that several FIRs have been filed in six states. Justice Bhushan replied: \"You want the FIRs to be quashed, then why can't you approach the High Courts?\" \nNariman said the web series makers have removed the objectionable content and still there are cases being filed against them. The top court questioned, why petitioners have moved the court under Article 32. \nThe bench said the police can file closure reports too if apologies have been made. \nRohatgi cited Arnab Goswami case to move the top court after a violation of Article 19(1)(a). He added people get offended with anything and everything these days. \"Please protect us with no coercive steps. We deleted content without any protest. Scenes have been deleted. It's a political satire,\" argued Rohatgi. \nRohatgi submitted that people are so sensitive in this country freedom to speech under then 19 (1)(a) would be destroyed.

{"title": "Kudi Yedamaithe (Web series): A well-made thriller", "date": "1 Aug 2021 12:30 AM GMT ", "description": "\"Kudi Yedamaithe\" is based on an interesting premise of two people having already lived through a particular day. They are trying to recollect things and make efforts on changing the turn of events. In the hands of a less compotent director the series would have crashed given the repetitive events and the concept of time loop but director Pawan Kumar does an extremely good job in making the audiences invested in the characters and also keeps them guessing.\nThe series spans eight episodes and never deviates from its core plot. The tension is well maintained and thankfully there are no unnecessary elements like comedy track and songs. For those who are not familiar with the name of the title, it is taken from a popular song in the film \"Devadasu\". The phrase \"Kudi Yedamaithe\" is used here referring an unexpected turn of events that pushes life upside down. \nAdi( Rahul Vijay) is an aspring actor who works as a food delivery agent for an agency. His routine starts from rushing to a neighbourhood food stall and having breakfast, this is followed by taking delivery orders and navigating through the city. In between he also gives auditions for roles in films. We get an idea of his bond with an older collegue called Farooq who cares for him. This is how his life goes and that day is no different. \nOn the other side of the coin there is a cop Durga played by Amala Paul. She is dependent on alchahol and is trying to focus on the tasks that she has to do for the day. There are cases regarding child kidnapping that she has to solve and also other challenging ones. As time becomes twelve both of them meet with an accident and dies, wakes up the following morning only to relive everything that happened all over again. \nThe rest of the series is about whether now both of them can change the turn of events that happened earlier since they are aware of what the rest of the day holds. The chief reason why \"Kudi Yedamaithe\" works is the way in which the events have been shown. Although they are common in nature you have subtle variations in the way they approach the situation. \nA good example of the subtle variations is the audition scenes of Adi. When Adi first goes to the audition there is certain nervousness but by the second time nervousness is replaced by confidence. The reason being he has already gone through the drill. The third time it becomes disdain because something else becomes a priority for Adi. \nThe same happens with Amala Paul's character too. The strategies that her character uses keep changing with the day as she is desperate to solve the crime. As the sense of urgency increases with both the characters you are riveted to the screen and want them to succeed. \nThe time loop is central to the plot and it could have easily gone into a boring zone, however it doesn't. Apart from Pawan Kumar the technical team is another reason why it never gets boring. The atmospherics contribute in a big way to the suspense factor. \nAmala Paul as Durga plays her complex character with ease. It is a treat to watch her performing. The surprise factor is Rahul Vijay. He also gets equal screen time and shows his potential. \n\"Kudi Yedamaithe\" ends on an interesting note and makes you excited for the second season. The web-series is premiered in Aha.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/webseries/kudi-yedamaithe-web-series-a-well-made-thriller-699156"},

I was in the studio and it seemed the most comfortable to me. More than a school, a playground, a cousin's house, or anywhere in the world, I thought it was the most beautiful place. \nWhen I look back at 25 years, I think it's very precious to me because you have to be blessed to be able to get a chance to make a film and that's why I cling on to the studio because the studio floor is the most magical, that's my temple, that's my everything.\" \nHe further added, \"'Heeramandi' was something that my friend Moin Baig got to me as a 14-page story, 14 years ago and then finally when we presented it to Netflix, they loved it and they thought it had great potential to make a mega-series. It is very ambitious, it's very big and vast. It tells you the story of courtesans. \nThey kept music, poetry and dance and the art of living. It shows the politics within the brothels and how to emerge as the winner. It is a difficult one but I hope we come across with flying colours this time.\" \nThe series will explore stories of courtesans and the hidden cultural reality of 'Heeramandi', a dazzling district, during pre-independent India.

Technology is the driving force in all aspects of our lives, whether they be personal or professional, from the moment we wake up until the moment we go to bed. AI plays a significant role in our lives, whether it is through receiving purchase recommendations on e-commerce platforms, recommendations on OTT platforms, or even emails. And to top it all off, the pandemic's effects have been so profound that digital has become the turning point for enterprises. They have been eager to go through digital changes in order to meet problems and get an advantage in the market. This is increasing the need for employees who are tech savvy and can propel organizational growth.\nAmong the wide range of technologies accessible, AI is anticipated to be creating a name for itself in a variety of fields. It is assuming center stage and revolutionizing every sector of the economy, including banking, healthcare, telecom, manufacturing, and education. While end-to-end automated processes are made possible by AI, its subdomains, such as Machine learning, Data and image analytics, also have a variety of uses. \nAutomating corporate activities, getting insights through data analysis, and interacting with customers and workers are the three main goals that AI is accountable for achieving. For instance, AI is revolutionizing disease diagnosis in the healthcare industry, particularly with picture analysis. It is essential for the development of new drugs as well as for using data analytics to expedite the trial process. AI even enhances the job of medical assistants who assist patients with daily care needs and enables wearable technology to check health issues remotely. In actuality, NLP is also converting the unrecognizable doctor's notes into structured data. Regarding the banking and finance industry, AI aids in the detection of insurance risk, fraud prevention, identification of the greatest investment opportunities, and even offering the best financial advice. \nArtificial intelligence (AI) has a wide range of applications in the education industry, and it assesses the learning gaps that exist and provides personalized learning solutions to the students, enhancing their effectiveness. AI frees up the time of the teachers by automating the repetitive chores so they may concentrate on their primary duties, like monitoring student progress and raising the bar for educational quality. Artificial intelligence has made education a 24/7/365 idea, and even educational information has become dynamic and interesting. The system allows for real-time communication with numerous pupils at once, dispelling their worries in real-time while acting as virtual assistants and AI tutors. Overall, it is true to state that AI is enhancing not only the lives of the general public but also transforming the face of several industries and enhancing the operations of enterprises across different industries. \nBut the truth is that we face a shortage of talented professionals. This suggests that the talents skill is important. Potential employees lack digital skills, particularly in AI, which is predicted to be the future of both the country and the sectors. \nArtificial intelligence technology enables organizations to personalize and tailor experiences and operations to increase consumer loyalty and engagement. It is becoming more popular with companies in many industries. Students seek PGDM programmes in artificial intelligence in order to become the leaders of the future who are AI-ready. They can get skill sets that will enable them to handle the complexity of the actual world by enrolling in AI-based training programmes offered by the B-schools. They will also learn how the solution is strategically applied to drive growth, conversions, and revenue. \nAccording to the International Data Corporation (IDC), India's AI market will be worth $7.8 billion by 2025 and expand at a CAGR of 20.2 percent. The country's AI software industry is anticipated to develop at a CAGR of 18.1% starting in 2020, but the AI services sector is anticipated to expand at 35.8%. All of these statistics show that as the market expands, it will also result in the creation of youth-focused AI-based jobs. The World Economic Forum predicts that AI will eventually lead to a variety of new work vocations. Data Scientists, experts in AI and machine learning. \nAccording to recent research from McKinsey, the adoption of artificial intelligence is considerably increasing along with the rise in digitization. This percentage is greater in Indian businesses than in APAC, and the survey also shows that AI's future prospects are anticipated to be bright. As a result, it is anticipated that business investments in AI would increase during the next 3 years. This tendency will undoubtedly increase demand for personnel who have the necessary training and work experience to benefit the organization. And this is why students would favor AI-based management studies. \n(The author is Chauhan, Dean (Corporate Relations), Professor IT)", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/education-careers/artificial-intelligence-courses-developing-tomorrows-leaders-759284"},

{"title": "Career Data Science versus Data Engineering", "date": "25 Aug 2022 9:30 PM GMT ", "description": "Industry 4.0 has revolutionised the interactions between data and industrial operations, creating numerous job opportunities in various sectors. A report released in 2017 famously said that data would be the most useful resource in the world, and this certainly holds true today. Big data has indeed changed the world, and companies today have access to several billion gigabytes of data generated every day at various operational stages. There is, therefore, significant emphasis on the role of data and analytics in the modern industrial structure.\nData Science is one of the fastest expanding sectors in the world, and in India- widely considered home to several large data-related operations, an array of data-related professions such as data science, data engineering, data analytics, data architects and big data engineers, provide significant opportunities for growth. Industries in which large volumes of data are generated constantly, such as Health Care, E-Commerce and Mobility, are in imminent need of data scientists and engineers. There has been a sharp incline in the global demand for data scientists and data engineers, and almost four-fifths of the world's enterprises have begun incorporating data scientists and data engineers into their business structures or future projects. With the demand for these professionals on the steady rise, there is no time like the present to delve into the nuances of each career and how you can pursue either profession. \nData Science refers to understanding and analysing certain core human abilities such as vision, speech and cognitive abilities, and designing machines and software applications meant to emulate these human actions. Data Science is an associated discipline of Big Data, designed to examine tremendous quantities of complicated or raw data, and offer relevant information to the firm based on that data. It makes it easier for businesses to improve their performance, efficiency, customer happiness, and financial goals. \nData Engineering on the other hand, involves the development and maintenance of data pipelines that are commonly used by data scientists for their analysis. It would not be incorrect to say that the data engineer sets the foundation that is built upon further by the data scientist. The biggest difference between the two is that while the former builds and maintains the pipeline systems and structures that store and organise data, the latter analyses the data to identify patterns and predict market behaviour, identify answers to questions relevant to operational activities, etc. \nData Scientists typically run projects that involve large volumes of data and are expected to explore and analyse the data, and identify and formulate questions and relevant findings. This means that a Data Scientist must possess broad knowledge of machine learning algorithms, statistics, and data mining and be aware of the different techniques used in big data infrastructures. Students interested in pursuing a career in Data Science must be proficient in programming languages such as SQL, Python, and Java, as well as possess competency in subjects such as multivariate calculus, probability, deep learning, and database management. \nOn the other hand, programming, system architecture, database design and configuration, interface and sensor configuration and distributed systems are among the skills considered necessary to pursue a career in data engineering. \nData engineers must possess an in-depth understanding of database management and SQL, along with proficiency in handling data transformation, mining and buffering tools. \nIt is evident that although data science and engineering have distinct skill requirements, there are areas of overlap between the two. This overlap means that both data scientists and engineers possess the requisite foundational knowledge to transition to the other side, with only minimal additional training required. \nThere is no recipe for success in any field. However, just as with any profession, it is important to ensure that your skills do not stagnate- brush up on technologies, programming, and increase proficiency in various programming languages and analytics tools. Build your practical experience and engage with the diverse data science community. And most importantly, never stop learning. The way data interacts with the world is constantly shifting, and every day brings with it new opportunities and possibilities. As an aspiring data scientist or data engineer, you must ensure that you constantly update yourself on new developments around you and keep learning! \n \n(The author is the Country Head and Director - IET India) ", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/education-careers/career-data-science-versus-data-engineering-759281"},
{"title": "IIT-D Researchers Propose Non-invasive Diagnostic Tool for Epileptogenic Zone Detection", "date": "5 Aug 2022 2:15 PM GMT ", "description": " Shedding more light on the cause and pivotal point on certain neurological disorder, a team of researchers from the \n, Delhi, have come up with a non-invasive EEG based Brain Source Localization (BSL) framework for epilepsy focal detection that is time efficient and patient friendly.\nEpilepsy is the fourth most common neurological disorder in the world and affects millions worldwide. It involves brief episodes of involuntary body (partial/entire) movement called seizures and may be accompanied by loss of consciousness and control of bowel or bladder function, primarily due to erroneous excessive electrical discharges. The team of researchers led by Professor Lalan Kumar, Department of Electrical Engineering, at the premier institute, have proposed novel head harmonics-based algorithms for seizure localization. \nDr. Amita Giri, a Prime Minister's Research Fellows (PMRF) in the Department of Electrical Engineering at IIT Delhi, has developed the novel epileptic region detection method as a major part of her Ph.D. work. The other members of the research team include Professor Tapan K. Gandhi, Electrical Engineering Dept., IIT Delhi and Dr. Nilesh Kurwale, Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital and Research Center, Pune, Maharashtra, India. \nSharing his views on the research, Professor. Lalan Kumar, Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Delhi, has said \"We have proposed utilization of spherical harmonics and head harmonics basis functions for seizure Localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in non-invasive and time efficient seizure Localization.\" \nThe researchers have validated the proposed source localization algorithms on clinical EEG data for epileptogenic zone localization. The proposed framework offers an effective solution to clinicians in automated and time efficient seizure localization. \nWhile in some cases epilepsy can be controlled by medicines, however, when medicines fail to control seizures, it is labelled as drug resistant epilepsy. Drug resistant epilepsies are most likely to originate from structural abnormalities of the brain and hence brain surgery offers a complete cure for these patients, provided the exact origin and extent of abnormality is identified by a neurosurgeon. \nAs per the researchers and clinical experts in the domain of neurology, these structural abnormalities are so subtle to be identified on MRI alone and always to be interpreted along with electroencephalogram (EEG) evaluation. Other modalities utilised by neurosurgeons are positron emission tomography (PET) scan, and Magnetoencephalography (MEG). PET scan involves intake of radioactive substances. The MEG facility is very limited in India. Craniotomy and Robot-assisted surgery are invasive where clinicians drill holes into the skull to place electrodes on the brain. It takes 2-8 hours for Epileptogenic Zone Detection and is uncomfortable for patients. \nProfessor. Lalan Kumar believes that the said research, titled 'Anatomical harmonics basis based brain source localization with application to epilepsy', could be a possible breakthrough considering the comfort of patients.

Ahuja, along with Dr Debarka Sengupta, has developed six independent machine learning based models that precisely scan every query compound for carcinogen-associated properties. Other clinical and research institutes such as IIT-Ropar, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, and CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi, have also participated in the research. \nAhuja said Metabokiller has vast importance and utilization in the pharma industry for the screening of new drugs. \"Of note, in the last few decades, many FDA-approved drugs have been taken back from the market since they were found to cause cancer. It also has huge importance in the cosmetics and food industries,\" he added.

{"title": "Doctors freeze newborn baby to save its life", "date": "22 Sep 2022 10:22 PM GMT ", "description": " In a miraculous case, a specialised team of neonatologists from Motherhood Hospitals, Bengaluru carried out a novel technique \u2013 \"Total Body Cooling\" procedure to save the life of a newborn baby (2-day old), who suffered a serious disturbance in the heart rhythm called neonatal supra ventricular tachycardia, that makes the heartbeat abnormally fast (250-280 per minute).\nThe NICU team at Motherhood Hospitals, Bengaluru received an emergency call from Dr. Srinivas from Hrudaya Hospital in Anantapur where a newborn baby girl was diagnosed with Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) and was admitted in a critical state. SVT is a medical condition where the heart beats faster than normal (120-160 per minute). In this case, the baby's heartbeat was almost double as compared to what is considered normal. \nThe NICU team at Motherhood Hospitals almost immediately left to retrieve the baby using \"NICU on Wheels\", which is an all-encompassing high-end transport vehicle with all the state-of the art NICU facilities used to transport newborn or critically ill babies. \nSince the distance between Anantapur and Bengaluru is more than 200 kilometres, the teams from both the hospitals decided to meet in Chikkaballapur, which is mid-way, as the baby required immediate medical attention. Upon reaching Chikkaballapur, the baby was immediately shifted to Motherhood NICU on wheels and was administered 3 doses of adenosine to slow her heart rate down. \nAdenosine works by stopping the heart for a second or so and then restarting there by bringing the heart rate to normal. However, even after receiving 3 doses of adenosine, the heart rate did not slow down. The baby was transferred to Motherhood NICU and was given 3 more medicines as continuous infusion to reduce the heart rate. Meanwhile, investigations including cardiac Echo, ECG, and blood tests were done to rule out other causes and ensure normal structure of the heart. Then the team went ahead to deliver shock to cardiovert the rhythm but in vain. \nSeeing no signs of improvement, the medical team lead by Dr. Prathap Chandra, Neonatologist and paediatrician from Motherhood Hospitals decided to use the Total Body Cooling technique to lower the baby's body temperature from 37o Celsius to 33.5o Celsius. This technique is commonly used in babies who do not cry after birth and whose brain does not receive sufficient oxygen. However, for a patient diagnosed with SVT, this was one of the first times, this technique was used. Cooling helped in significantly lowering the heart rate and bringing back the normal rhythm in the baby, thus saving her life. The baby has now completely recovered from this condition and is hale and hearty, visiting for regular check-ups. The recovery of the baby can be completely owed to timely detection and treatment of the baby at the hands of specialised medical experts. Commenting on the efforts of the doctors, Vijayarathna Venkatraman, CEO at Motherhood Hospitals said \"We are proud of the fact that our team of expert clinicians and support staff were able to save the life of this child with their expertise. We offer high intensity neonatal care, 24/7 and ensure tiny new-borns born with complications are restored to health.' \nSpeaking about the NICU program, Head of Medical operations, Motherhood Hospitals, Bengaluru, Dr Pallav Gupta said, \"The Neonatology program in motherhood is the largest in the region. We have successfully treated more than 14,000 new-born/ prematurely born babies. 40 per cent of these babies are retrieved from remote areas of Karnataka (like Koppal, Hubbali, Chikkamangaluru, Anantpur, Chitradurga, Bellary, Hassan, Kadapa and Gadag to name a few) through our Neonatal Transport \u2013 'NICU on Wheels'. Our integrated Neonatology Team gives the best care to babies who require NICU support.\" \nDr. Prathap Chandra added, \"It was one of the most challenging cases and our only priority was to save the baby's life. Since SVT is a condition which disrupts blood flow, to vital organs, cooling helped to reduce the basal metabolic rate, thereby reducing her heart rate. The baby is now almost 4 months old & has been regularly visiting for check-ups and has recovered well.\" \nExpressing his joy, the baby's grandfather Marriswamy Naik said, \"My family and I are eternally grateful to the entire team at Motherhood Hospitals for treating my granddaughter and giving her a new lease of life. We had lost hope completely and were devastated to see her in that condition. Upon bringing her to Bengaluru, the doctors went out of their way to save the baby.\"", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/karnataka/doctors-freeze-newborn-baby-to-save-its-life-762758"},

According to the law, smoking is prohibited in all public places like bus stops, railway stations, government offices, hospitals, hotels, parks, and other places where the public has access to.\nWe have numerous scientific reports that have listed the harms arising out of tobacco smoke. Exposure to second-hand smoke (tobacco smoke) is proven to be as harmful as active smoking. Second-hand smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals that can cause premature deaths and diseases. A widely prevailing misconception among the public is that they think tobacco smoke affects only the smoker. The sad reality is that this serious public health concern of second-hand smoking is relatively ignored. \nIt causes stroke, heart, cancers, lung diseases and gangrene of the feet. The smoke emitted by a smoker lingers in the air for hours which can also cause asthma. The environment protection agency has identified tobacco smoke as a cause for cancer. Passive smoking is more harmful to children as it causes Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Another important and subtle danger that smoking in public places does is corrupting the young mind with the falsehood that smoking is not harmful and socially acceptable behavior. \nThere are about 120 million smokers in India. Of this 14.3 lakh, people were fined for smoking in public places in India since 2019. It's about 1.7 percent. How many of these 14.3 lakhs people are not going to offend again? A senior police officer of the state said in one of our webinars shared that Rs. 200 levied as a fine is too little and does not act as a deterrent. Tobacco control advocates have been appealing to the government to increase the fine amount from the existing Rs 200 to at least Rs.2000. There is an argument that the offenders may not have so much money to pay the fine. The judicial system does not ask offenders of other types if they have the money to pay for violations. \nMost smokers are lawbreakers as they smoke in public places. The majority of them know that it's a violation. They are not only spoiling their health but also threatening the health of all the people around. Easy accessibility of tobacco products everywhere paves way for the violation of smoking in public places. Petty shops are hotspots for tobacco consumption. This is one of the many Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) violations that petty shops do. Desirable social change with regard to the situation would be achieved if the harmful effect of tobacco is included in the school textbooks. Which should also be creatively taught. Se condly, we need political commitment to ensure all educational institutions and public places are 100 percent smoke-free. This can be achieved by strengthening COTPA. Thirdly every non-smoker who is aware of the harmful effects of tobacco must object to smokers next to them. This will also create awareness among other non-smokers who are not aware of the harmful effects of tobacco. \nEvery cigarette or bidi purchased contributes to generating huge revenue for tobacco companies. The sheer money power of the tobacco industry paves way for huge scandals in which some of the custodians of society are involved. Further, it subverts the public health policies which lead to diseases and the death of million. What is the cost of 13 lakhs avertable deaths in India every year and who will pay for it? Society must turn the tide against the tobacco industry and urge for strong COTPA. \n(The author is convenor of Consortium for Tobacco Free Karnataka, an organisation working towards tobacco control since 2001)", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/news/cities/bengaluru/why-are-we-mute-to-smoking-in-public-places-a-serious-public-health-threat-763920"},

Despite the growing popularity of anti-aging treatments such as Botox or dermal fillers, chemical peeling remains popular today.\nHowever, face peels are occasionally advertised in a way that could be deceptive. \"The truth is that there is a wide range in the effectiveness and recovery time associated with facial peels. Patients are more likely to be happy with the outcome of their surgery if they know what to anticipate. It is simple to become perplexed about how chemical peels genuinely function because there are so many variations on the theme. Consequently, learn the facts regarding these through chemical peel myths,\" says Dr. Navnit Haror, Founder and Director of Derma Miracle Clinic who shares the top 7 Myths and the truths of this treatment. \nTruth: There are several different kinds of peels; some are light and need little recovery time, while others are much deeper. Alpha and beta hydroxyl peels are lighter peels with less exfoliation and redness, whereas deeper peels are more potent and may have greater exfoliation and redness. \nTruth: Permanent scarring won't be an issue if the peel is carried out by a qualified skin care specialist. Deeper peels often cause redness and peeling, but today there are many superficial choices and breakthroughs in cosmeceutical compositions that calm inflammation, repair, and rebuild the skin. The peels produce healthier, smoother, and more youthful-looking skin over the long run. \nTruth: In actuality, chemical peels can benefit all types of skin, even sensitive skin. Chemical peels can prevent problems as well as treat skin that is prone to them. Skin cell turnover occurs normally every 21 to 28 days. This rate often slows down starting in the late 20s, depending on the severity of the skin damage. The cellular turnover will be boosted to stimulate healthy cell growth while exfoliating dead cells if you receive a very mild skin peel at Face Perfect Clinic, such as the alpha or beta hydroxyl acids, both of which are superficial peeling procedures. \nTruth: Over time, the skin becomes thicker because superficial chemical peels encourage the production of collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid. The epidermal skin cells can be removed from the skin by exfoliating it numerous times, but they will always grow back. The dermis, which lacks stem cells, is affected by medium-depth and deep peels. As a result, it is possible to thin or over-exfoliate the skin. Given the intervals between deep peels and the fact that most people only get a deep peel once or twice in their lifetime, this is an unusual occurrence. \nTruth: This is false. The majority of chemical peels have the potential to erase freckles, UV damage, fine lines, and wrinkles in addition to age spots and acne scars. In conclusion, a chemical peel administered by a professional can significantly enhance the look of the skin on the face, hands, neck, and decolletage. Your skin can look smoother and healthier after a skin peel. \nTruth: Having a breakout following a peel is NOT unusual. Peels are a type of exfoliation; thus, they frequently cause the skin to become cleansed and bring items to the surface. Although they are uncomfortable, breakouts are frequently brief and an essential element of the peeling process in order to rejuvenate the skin and obtain desired outcomes.\nTruth: The truth is that chemical peels work incredibly well to cure dry skin. The restoration of the skin's natural moisture barrier and improved product penetration of your moisturizers and other hydrating products are both made possible by the elimination of dead skin. \nA chemical peel is a type of cosmetic surgery that can help to reduce the look of facial ageing. During a chemical peel, a dermatologist will apply a chemical solution to your skin. This therapy removes damaged skin cells, allowing new, healthy skin to grow in its stead.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/featured/womenia/myths-and-facts-about-chemical-peeling-762390"},

An important name among these women is Shaheena Akhtar, a resident of Srinagar, who is associated with the historic handicraft industry 'Kani Shawl'.\nAkhtar, in a very short time, has become one of the successful women entrepreneurs of the Kashmir Valley. She is known and recognised not only locally but also nationally in the business. \nHailing from the Nowshera area of Srinagar, Shaheena Akhtar is the first person in her family to have completed graduation. In 2004, she learned the art of making a Kani under the guidance of her brother. With self-confidence and courage, Akhtar also played an important role in improving the financial condition of her household. She started participating in handicraft exhibitions on her own to promote the handicraft industry and eliminate the interference of the middlemen. So it proved to be quite beneficial. \nAkhtar worked as a woman artisan in Kani Shawl Looms, though she had to listen to people's taunts at first, but with courage and determination, she made her dream come true. Today, many Kani Shawl looms are running in the villages, including the city of Srinagar, in which hundreds of men and women artisans are earning their jobs. \nShe has so far participated in various handicraft exhibitions at the national and international level where her work has not only been appreciated but her shawls have also been well received. She says, \"At one time, we used to make only two lakh rupees in profit for the whole year, but when I participated in the exhibition for the first time, we made a much bigger profit and it was the first step to success after which there was no looking back.\" \nPashmina wool obtained from rare Ladakh sheep is used to make Kani shawls. First, this wool is finely spun on a spinning wheel to turn it into fine yarn, and then a Kani shawl is made from pashmina threads of different colours. Akhtar does not compromise on the quality, as a result of which she receives orders from all over the country and abroad. \nThis woman entrepreneur has been awarded with several honours so far. While many women have been inspired by Shaheena Akhtra's self-confidence. Success in any work can be achieved with courage, dedication and determination. In such a situation, she has not only become a successful women entrepreneur but also a beacon for other Kashmiri women.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/featured/womenia/shaheena-akhtar-the-kani-queen-of-kashmir-763767"},

Her performances have been highly acclaimed by the art circle and general public alike. For her dedication to the art form, she has received the, Yuva Ratna Award (Rotary Club), National FICCI young achievers award, Devadasi National Award (Orissa) and National Bismillah Khan Yuva Puraskar. She established in the Natya Tarangini Hyderabad Centre in 2007 and under her guidance the institute has completed 15 years of its existence. \nYamini Reddy trains students of various age groups in the art of Kuchipudi dance at Natya Tarangini Hyderabad. She also has her own troupe with whom she performs regularly. The students at the centre are trained in the most professional standards set by the guidance of Gurus Raja Radha, Kaushalya Reddy and Yamini Reddy. The repertory is acclaimed for its finesse in technique, choreography and presentation in the Kuchipudi dance style. For last 15 years Natya Tarangini Hyderabad has successfully trained numerous students in the art of Kuchipudi and established itself as a premier institution in Telangana. \nGurus Padmabhushans Dr(s) Raja Radha Reddy started Natya Tarangini in 1976 in the capital city of New Delhi with aim of preserving and propagating Indian art and culture. The Hyderabad branch was started in 2007. \nIn an exclusive conversation with The Hans India, Yamini Reddy shares her happiness on completing fifteen years of 'Natya Tarangini - Hyderabad'. Let's have a look into it. \nSpeaking about how it started, Yamini says, \"The Natyatarangini was an institute started by my parents in 1976 in Delhi, and now it's completing 50 years, But I started the Natyatarangini Hyderabad branch when I came to Hyderabad here in 2007. It was for me I wanted I was new here, and I wanted to I guess I just started by, wanted to keep myself busy at that time, and I started teaching. But the institute started growing, and I started taking so much interest. I wanted to pass this beautiful art form of Kuchipudi to the younger generation. And that's why I started teaching here. I started Natyatarangini Hyderabad branch, and it is now completing 15 years.\" \n\"I definitely feel wonderful now that the branches completing 15 years, sometimes I can't believe it, how time has flown and 15 years have passed. And I look at my students who came to me, some of them came to me when they were so tiny, and they're now all grown and have become beautiful dancers. And at some level I too feel very fulfilled and satisfied to see a culmination of my work and teaching in these students that I have been training and it's just certain such a wonderful journey,\" Yamini says. \nSpeaking about the challenges, Yamini said, \"The main challenge was building a circle as I am new to the city. Once I set it up I decided that I am taking it very slow and even if I have 3 students I am going to start with 3 students then I see where it goes. But with God's blessings and of course with my Guru and my parents blessings Institute picked up very well within 1 year and classes picked up then subsequently it grew and grew. I think I just came on board with that.\" \n\"The recent challenge was at Covid times. Large no. of students, large no. of challenges we faced with. We went online overnight and we had to adapt to the online medium because I was not into online before Covid. But I managed to adapt take the classes online platform. I am very happy to I did so instead of discontinuing the classes,\" she added. \nTalking about her inspirations, Yamini says, \"My inspiration is definitely my parents because they not only inspired me professionally, they also inspired me personally in personal lives. They have so many qualities and they taught me so much. That's why they are my first inspiration. Other than that I'm also inspired by many Krishnamurti and Zakir Hussain. They are also all inspiring because of their sheer hard work which they have kept into their art. \nYamini feels nothing can be done alone in this life. \"It is very difficult to manage the role of being a mother, a teacher and a performer. It is challenging, sometimes life gets stressful, but nothing can be done alone in this life. I think I have a very good support system in terms of my family around me who are here to support me. And when I need help, I don't hesitate to ask. And, if I'm busy, they're there to be there for everything that I need.\" \nSpeaking about her future works, Yamini said, \"I have started my own newsletter for Kuchipudi dance and even certain topic about performing arts in general and every month I takeout an issue and we deal with subjects related to dance often subjects which are not academic related to dance like about copyright or even capitalism in performing arts and how we should deal with it in this current scenario. So that has been keeping me busy other than that I have been doing couple of dance sessions called \"Back to Basics\" on Instagram and they have been a hit. I will be continuing with those and hope to continue teaching and do more good work through NatyaTarangini.\" \"Especially it was always my passion to see art sector in India more organised and I hope that I can dedicate rest of my life to kind of building toward this. That is my goal. If I can see it in my life time I will be really blessed,\" Yamini concluded.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/featured/womenia/i-wanted-to-see-art-sector-in-india-more-organised-yamini-reddy-762995"},

In a tribute to the anticipation of the heartening days ahead, homegrown, everyday wear brand, trueBrowns launches its latest collection, Maati, in association with ace actor, Chitrangda Singh, not only helming the hat of the co-creator but, also as the face of this festive edit. \nMaati presents an alluring selection of 59 styles, quintessential for the upcoming festive days, integrating luxe fabrics, and exclusive designs, however, not drifting away from its core design mantra - comfort. With Chitrangda preaching the same design aesthetic as that of the brand, which is, minimalism, the collection brings to the foreground, pieces that address, functional festive. Comprising of fusion wear with ethnic silhouettes and modern cuts, the brand has played with an extensive range of hues, varying from dainty pastels to festive brights. \nElated with coming on board as the co-creator and face of this collection, Chitrangda Singh, says, \"trueBrowns is a brand that speaks volumes about today's traditional yet modern woman. I have always believed in standing tall and strong because I sincerely feel that women are allowed to make their own choices and decisions.\" \nIn a conversation, Chitrangada shares about her fashion and future works. Let's have look into it. \nThere is always style over comfort because of our professional commitments. I am always dying to get into my pyjamas once I get back home. So yes, it is style over comfort for me. \nFor me, it has always been very classic, simple, straight lines along with clean silhouettes. I personally love colours, therefore anything with jewel tones that one can play with, as in my opinion they work beautifully on our brown skin tone. I believe that less is more aesthetically. I love working with classics, with a more vintage look and cut as I feel that, that is something that has always worked for me. \nI believe it is important. Social media has become such a relevant part of our lives, and not only for celebrities but everyone in general. It has become a necessity to communicate with people and for us, even more. Having said that, I am not someone who is fiercely active on social media, I feel that you remain relevant with the kind of work that you put out. For me as an actor, it is important that my work is relevant. \nOf course, one is so much more beyond being just an actor but, you must be real and authentic too. It is impossible to keep up a facade for too long. I do not believe in faking it just to increase my follower count. Staying true to yourself will get you genuine followers with whom you will enjoy interactions too. \nWell, I have already forayed into OTT with Modern Love, which was an anthology. It was titled, Cutting Chai and I worked with Arshad Warsi for the same. I am yet to do a full flagged series which I am awaiting and I hope I can come by something which is interesting enough. I feel when you are part of a series, it is very important for the content to be good enough to hold the audiences for such a long period of time as opposed to a two-hour long film. I am really looking forward to it and this is the way to go. OTT is the future and I hope I get something exciting soon.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/featured/womenia/i-do-not-believe-in-faking-to-increase-my-follower-count-chitrangada-763209"},

As this year is approaching an end, and with the current pace of work it is evident that the 'Kashmir to Kanyakumari' dream will soon be a reality. \nThe Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Railway Link (USBRL) is an all-weather, cost-effective line that will be a boon to the economy of the \n. By this month, the railway link has generated five crore man-days of employment. The first three phases of the project are complete. Trains are operational between Baramulla-Banihal in Kashmir Valley and Jammu-Udhampur-Katra in the Jammu Region. The work on the topographically challenging 111-km section between Katra and Banihal is ongoing. \nThe Railways have granted an opportunity to districts such as Reasi and Ramban to find suitable employment and more work. Medical facilities, education, and business activities are now more accessible to the population. Today the work on more than 75 per cent of the total 37 bridges and 97.6 per cent of tunnels on the Katra-Banihal section is complete. So far, the construction of this section alone stands at Rs 30,672.34 crore. \nThe Railways have built more than 205-km long approach roads which include a tunnel and 320 bridges. 73 villages of the region which were earlier only accessible by foot or boats are now a part of our civilization through this railway connection. 65 per cent of the people employed in railway construction are locals. \nBetween the 137-km Banihal-Baramulla corridor rail link, Kashmir will soon get its first electric train. The project which costs a total of Rs 324 crore will be inaugurated on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti (October 2) this year. The project has three main substations - Qazigund, Budgam, and Baramulla - which will supply power to the overhead equipment of the line. The trials on the line will be completed on September 20th and the final mandatory inspection of this much-awaited project will take place on September 26. The electrification of this rail link will not only reduce pollution in the area but also save 60 per cent fuel consumption. The UT government, Indian Railways, and Indian Railway Construction Limited have been working on the project since August 2019. \nIndian Railways with the support of the administration have pushed for the timely completion of all projects despite the pandemic-related hurdles along the way. \nOne amazing feat worth a million mentions is the Chenab Bridge, the highest arch railway bridge in the world. Built at the cost of Rs 1,250 crore, the architectural marvel stands 35 meters higher than the Eiffel Tower! The pictures shared by the Railway Ministry have been trending on Twitter since the last week. In the pleasant season of Monsoon, the bridge almost looks like something out of a fairytale drowned in a sea of clouds. The golden hour pictures of the bridge look so breathtaking, that Twitterati checked with the Railway Ministry for pre-booking of the train ride! \nWhile the construction of the bridge is complete, the laying of the ballastless track below will soon begin. It is expected to be open to the public by the end of this year or the beginning of the next. Also known as the \"Golden Joint of the Deck,\" the 1.315 km mega iconic structure stands over the gorge of Chenab River in the Reasi district of Jammu and Kashmir at the height of 359 meters above the river bed. \nPrefabricated portions of the 785 meters deck were launched from both ends and then joined. The two sections of the bridge were put in place by the HSFG (High Strength Friction Grip) bolts. The bridge can combat winds at the speed of 260 kmph. For the engineers it was a journey full of obstacles while fighting against the complex geography and weather adversaries of the region, to say the least. \nThis project has witnessed many \"Firsts\" - for the first time in the country power operated cars were used for inspection and maintenance of bridges; a continuous health monitoring and warning system is in place; the cable crane assembly that was used for the erection of the steel pillars of the bridge is 915 meters long, one of the longest in the world; one of the pylons of cable crane (127 meters) is higher than the Qutub Minar (72 meters); it is for the first time that a bridge has been designed for blast load with the supervision of DRDO; a phased Array Ultrasonic Testing machine is in use for the inspection of welds; and a NABL accredited lab is testing the welded elements in the Indian Railways and the bridge for the endurance of earthquake forces of zone V. \nThe world's most advanced and modern technologies are being used for the planning and construction of this project. In many instances, new technologies were developed along the way and existing methods were iterated by experts from India and abroad for the execution of the project. \nThis project is the highest altitude railway network in India - defying gravity on the impossible terrain of the Pir Panjal Mountain range. Indian Railways' 'Future Ready' railway system will surely go down as the new chapter of J&K's glory, development, and prosperity.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/news/national/kashmir-railway-link-bridging-the-economic-gaps-762570"},

Vuyolwethu Simanile set a \n for the fastest consumption of 121g of chicken feet in 60 seconds.\nFour of Vuyo's coworkers from the Mashamplanes Lounge, a shisa nyama restaurant and bar, competed against her. Shisa nyama, which means \"burn meat\" in Zulu, refers to the method of cooking meat over open flames of coals.\nShisa nyama, however, is about more than just grilling meat; it's about uniting people in a warm, social setting; it's about eating, drinking, and dancing together; it's about camaraderie and soul. Therefore, Mashamplanes, which is well-known for its hot chicken feet, was the only site to find a record holder for this newly-created title.\nA new e.tv programme called Stumbo Record Breakers, which explores the extraordinary, extreme, and outstanding talents of South Africans, featured the record attempt in episode one.\nAdjudicator Sofia Greenacre placed 300 g (10.5 oz) of chicken feet on each participant's plate prior to the start of the official attempt.\nOnly one chicken foot may be picked up and consumed at a time in order to break this record; doing so disqualifies the holder. An airhorn signalled the start of the effort, and the 60 seconds of ferocious chewing began.\nEach contestant had a somewhat different approach; some went for a more frantic manner, while others went for a more methodical one.\nVuyo cleaned off bone after bone with an understated efficiency that went unnoticed. Those who moved quickly soon slowed down as they struggled with the gelatinous consistency.\nSofia, the adjudicator, weighed each plate at the end with any extra foot on top to determine how much had been consumed. This record is based on grammes consumed rather than how many complete chicken feet were ingested. A chicken foot typically weighs 35 g. A minimum of 110 g had to be consumed to qualify as a record-breaking meal.\nThe Stumbo Record Breakers hosts, Carla Classen and Thapelo Motloung, highlighted three of the competitors as probable victors while they awaited Sofia's decision. Nevertheless, none of these forecasts came true. In actuality, only one contender had complied with the minimal standard.\nVuyo was announced to have achieved a new world record for the most chicken feet consumed in a minute, to to everyone's surprise\u2014including her own.

WCD is supported by various eminent government and international NGOs. \n \n\u2022\tAwareness about the different kinds of contraceptives available helps individuals to make informed choices \n\u2022\tThe prevention of unintended pregnancies plays a pivotal role in reducing the incidence of maternal ill-health and deaths \n\u2022\tContraception and family planning can be beneficial in delaying pregnancies in young girls and older women who are at an increased risk of health problems from unintended pregnancies \n\u2022\tBy reducing rates of unintended pregnancies, it also significantly minimizes the need for unsafe abortion while lowering the risk of HIV transmissions from mothers to newborns \n\u2022\tIt also helps individuals avoid sexually transmitted infections \n\u2022\tAccess to contraceptives, moreover, has allowed individuals to make planned pregnancies with space, and avoid unwanted ones. This has proven to reduce the maternal and infant mortality rate \n\u2022\tAs better contraception leads to better family planning, this also helps many families lift themselves out of poverty \n \nWomen can choose from many different types of birth control methods. These include (in order of most effective to least effective at preventing pregnancy): \n\u2022\tFemale and male sterilization (female tubal ligation or occlusion, male vasectomy) \u2014 Birth control that prevents pregnancy for the rest of your life through surgery or a medical procedure. \n\u2022\tLong-acting reversible contraceptives or \"LARC\" methods (intrauterine devices, hormonal implants) \u2014 Birth control that your doctor inserts one time and you do not have to remember to take every day or month. LARCs last for 3 to 10 years, depending on the method. \n\u2022\tShort-acting hormonal methods (pill, mini pills, progesterone injections, patch) \u2014 Birth control that your doctor prescribes that you remember to take every day or month. \n\u2022\tBarrier methods (condoms, diaphragms) \u2014 Birth control that you use each time you have sex. \n\u2022\tNatural rhythm methods \u2014 Not using a type of birth control but instead avoiding sex and/or using birth control only on the days when you are most fertile \n \nThere is no \"best\" method of birth control for every woman. The birth control method that is right for you and your partner depends on many things and may change over time. Before choosing a birth control method, talk to your gynaecologist about: \n\u2022\tWhether you want to get pregnant soon, in a few years, or never \n\u2022\tHow well each method works to prevent pregnancy \n\u2022\tPossible side effects \n\u2022\tYour overall health \n\u2022\tHow comfortable you are with using the method (For example, can you remember to take a pill every day?) \n \n(The author is a Consultant Gyneacologist at Apollo Cradle & Childrens Hospital, Hyderabad) ", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/featured/womenia/everything-about-contraception-763081"},

{"title": "Rubies: Girls' new best friend", "date": "24 Sep 2022 7:31 PM GMT ", "description": "Good things come in small packages, especially when it comes to gemstones. Rubies, commonly known as the Manik, is a naturally occurring gemstone that is a type of aluminium oxide. It is chemically composed of aluminium, iron, chromium, and oxygen. The value of this gemstone is determined first by its colour, then by its cut and carat.\nThere are different reasons and benefits why people prefer to wear ruby gemstones according to Milind Mathur, Creative Director, and Partner of Kohinoor Jewellers Agra & Kohgem, and Piyush Gupta, PP Jewellers by Pawan Gupta. Take a look: \n \nThe wearer of a ruby gemstone can conquer timidity easily. Specifically, those who lack confidence or are afraid to put their opinions forward, and feel that nobody values their opinions. The Sun is a natural Atma karaka, thus being in direct contact with the ruby stone will boost your confidence and opinion of yourself. \n \nRuby gems denote the influencing character of the Sun, the central organ of the solar system binding all the planets revolving around it with natural force. The Sun is a guardian figure and has an immense contribution as a curator of life. Therefore, wearing a Ruby adds up to the additional solidity to improve your paternal and marital relationships. The embedded Ruby in pendants or rings holds up your heavenly energy and improves your relationship with the close ones by opening the door of generosity for them. \n \nRuby is a wonderful foundation of nature and has a strong relation with Earth. It is found in the lap of Earth, containing natural dispositions that offer a wide array of health benefits. The stone has an incredible impact on our entire body system, including the heart, blood, and ventricles. It revitalises blood circulation, improves heart conditions, and heals various health problems. The Ruby stone is admired for its detoxification abilities for everyone. It also helps in controlling menstruation and calms the aggravation during the cycle. \n \nA Ruby can guard its wearer against evil spirits and bad dreams, whenever it is placed under the pillow. It is beneficial for the individual who gets too many nightmares or feels negative energy. It is often advised to wear this stone as gems where it contacts your skin as immediate contact rises above the energy and powers of the gemstone to your chakras. Subsequently, you will find positive changes in your persona and energies encompassing you. \n \nRuby stone enhances one's creativity that in turn leads to better career prospects. It furnishes the idea of success, hope, improving character, and fame. The gem wearers receive positive impressions in their professional as well as personal life. \n \nRuby is properly the lord of jewels. It has always been associated with authority all around history. A person having a pleasing position of the sun in their horoscope can wear a native ruby stone for a kingly status and luxury. \n \nIt clears confusion and increases focus thereby making its wearer sharp, vigilant, and graceful. This is the striking benefit of the Ruby gemstone", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/featured/womenia/rubies-girls-new-best-friend-762997"},

I never thought to do rap song but I wrote and intend to tried my best to give my audiences something fresh. Now a days, mostly with so many romantic numbers releasing my song is a fresh breathe of air where I did something unique for my audience. In India, there are very few female rappers so I don't mind to take challenge as a Rapper. This is a song based on a heart break story. This video tells a pop star's real life story to the audience. I'm very sure people will love the video as much as the song.\" \nTalking about there being very less female centric music videos or female pop singers in Bollywood with emphasis more on romantic music videos she states, \"Well, no offense to do a music video with a hero. If there is a requirement then obviously cast a hero but when a singer or actor wants to tell her story then why we put a male actor just for the sake of it. Audience accepted female centric film, so they must accept a female centric music video too.\" \n She further talks about how western female pop singers are renowned and accepted worldwide which needs to change in Bollywood as well. She says,\"We need to grow up now. We already loved and liked hollywood female pop singers starting from Shakira to Cardy B, JLO to Dua lipa and now we are fan of Black pink (K-pop). Audience and listeners are changing day by day. They want something new so we should try to give something better than yesterday. Hence, I tried to give audience something new in my new song Jee Lene Do.\" \n Talking about her upcoming projects and future aspirations she tells,\"I'm in talks with few production houses, can't say anything.

{"title": "Feel beautiful inside out", "date": "3 Oct 2022 10:54 PM GMT ", "description": "Nothing is more significant or exciting than selecting the ideal clothing for the holiday season. Additionally, choosing the right shapewear to go with your particular outfit and give you the ideal shape is just as important as choosing the right outfit. Wearing cozy shapewear is a need for a confident look whether you opt for a sari, lehenga, Anarkali, or kurta combo. \n\"Shapewear is designed to hug your body tightly and contour your body into a more proportioned shape. It will make you feel more confident when wearing your favorite piece of clothing,\" says Pooja Merani, COO-Wacoal. \nAppearance: There are primary areas that are addressed by body-shaping lingerie: the bust, waist, hips, and thighs. One big benefit of wearing shapewear is that you instantly get that feminine silhouette without having to lose weight or see a cosmetic surgeon. \nThe elastic nature of shapewear provides compression and encourages you to stand with your back straighter and firmer. The support also alleviates pain, particularly in the lumbar area and the lower back. \nShapewear can change your outward appearance, it can change your attitude towards weight loss as well. Most women who wear shapewear are encouraged to retain a healthy and active lifestyle. Sporting curves and managing to slip into that slinky dress also gives you a boost in self-esteem and confidence to wear your desired clothes. \nShapewear can aid the body as it undergoes the aging process; and can support symptoms such as humpback, pail waist, fat buttock, flat hip, bulky leg, turnip leg, etc. \nWomen who have toiled for hours to reduce their waistline often experience muffin tops even though they are in good shape. Due to the cut of today's trendy clothes, when wearing low-rise jeans and fitted tops, shapewear can fix this problem. The greatest time to make a shapewear purchase is now if you genuinely enjoy wearing bodycon dresses and other fitting clothing. The different types of shape wear are. \nThis hi-waist shaper lifts your rear, controls your tummy, defines your waist, and virtually disappears under clothes, making it the perfect foundation for any outfit you build on top. \n To hide the muffin top and love handles. They are definitely more comfortable than full-body suits. They completely smooth out your upper body and even manage to hide those awful bra bulges. They are great to wear with trousers, jeans, or a skirt. \nAs the name suggests, bust shapewear shapes the bust area and enhances it. Bust shapewear lifts the breasts, gives them a more firm look, and also works better than your regular push-up bra. \nHigh waist shapewear panties are gaining popularity, thanks to their ability to give a firm look as they effectively tighten the stomach and waist regions to give shape. They can also help in regaining your pre-pregnancy posture and shape. Long-time use of high shapewear strengthens the abdominal muscles, which can help the internal organs pull back and return to their normal position. \nTummy bulge is one of the hardest things to control. We often try to hide it behind our loose-fitted tops and dresses. Tummy tuckers can help to flatten your tummy as well as love handles and give you a smooth and slimmer look under fitted dresses and tops. \nThey are full-body suits with a chest cut out. They look somewhat like a swimsuit but are majorly different. You get an overall smoothing effect as they help in smoothing out the stomach, hide the bulges, lift your bosom area and also make your bum look great. They can be worn under any clothing item from casual wear to a traditional or festive outfit.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/featured/womenia/feel-beautiful-inside-out-764137"},
{"title": "'Role of women freedom fighters needs to be made more enduring'", "date": "1 Oct 2022 10:17 PM GMT ", "description": "While the role of women in the freedom struggle has been \"highlighted to a very large extent\" of late, a lot more needs to be done to \"make their stories more enduring\" as tokenism in the name of issuing commemorative stamps or naming programmes in their memory \"may not be enough\", says multi-dimensional author Anu Kumar in a new book that vividly recreates the lives of 35 women who relentlessly fought for India's Independence. \n\"I'd think in recent decades their role has been highlighted to a very large extent. Historians of gender, social scientists have brought to light stories of heroism on the part of women from varied regions of India,\" Kumar told in an interview of her book, \"Her Name Was Freedom - 35 Fearless Women Who Fought For Indian Independence\" (Hachette), adding: \"Sometimes though just issuing stamps and naming a programme in their memory may not be enough.\" \n\"As for permanency, maybe there should be more of them in school textbooks; and more books about them, certainly - their stories added (not substituted) to the wider struggle by many others. And maybe films, podcasts, series on them too. Everything that's possible to make their stories enduring, really. \n\"If more women's stories were highlighted, maybe this world would be a peaceful, kinder place, I daresay,\" Kumar elaborated. \nThus, it was not surprising that she \"jumped at the offer\" when her Hatchette editor, Vatsala Kaul-Banerjee, with whom she's worked for a long time, asked her if she'd \"like to work on something like this\". \n\"It was simply too exciting, I knew I'd love doing the research that it involved, to bring alive the period of our freedom struggle, to bring to life these women who were involved in it as much as the men, and who somehow, or in some cases, were seen as secondary to the movement,\" Kumar explained. \nA considerable amount of research went into the writing of the book. \n\"I looked up primary accounts: the memoirs written by the likes of Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay, Durgabai Deshmukh, Qudsia Rasul, Kalpana Dutta, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, and others, for these evoke that period and time most vividly, and other accounts by their peers, such as Yusuf Meherally writing about Aruna Asaf Ali, for example, some newspaper accounts of the time, and then later secondary accounts, work by historians and writers,\" Kumar said. \nIs there a common strain running through the women featured in the book that explains what motivated them to stand up and be counted? \n\"There was this realization for all these amazing women that political freedom could not come without emancipation on all fronts -- the upliftment of women, the marginalized sections. Freedom didn't just mean end of British rule, but an end to oppressive social customs, including caste inequities as well,\" Kumar said. \nThus, in this book, the reader will come across a brave queen of Avadh who led her kingdom during an uprising, a 73-year-old freedom fighter who stood her ground against British soldiers, a fearless teen hero from Nagaland who defended the rights of her community, and many more. \nBravely setting out from their homes, these homemakers and princesses, politicians and poets, doctors and artists, and lawyers and educationists marched in protest, starved on hunger strikes, rallied supporters, went to jail and led from the front. From Sarojini Naidu to Matangini Hazra, from Aruna Asaf Ali to Rani Gaidinliu, from Muthulakshmi Reddi to Hansa Mehta, and from Annie Mascarene to Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, they showed amazing courage in breaking their shackles and facing grave challenges to liberate the country. \nGiven that besides writing for children, Kumar also writes historical fiction for older readers and that she has immersed herself in history for most of her life, having studied the subject in college and later at university, this explains the wide swathe of time the profiles cover \n\"It's been a journey of varied writing experiences, and I am still learning. I was in the editorial section of the Economic and Political Weekly, my first novel ('Letters for Paul') came in 2006, and my first book for younger readers, 'Atisa and the Seven Wonders' appeared in 2008. So all these varied writing experiences have helped me learn, and I still like this journey I am on,\" Kumar elaborated. \nWhen Anu was questioned how does she strike a balance between writing for children and writing historical fiction for older readers, she said, \"Most of my writing for younger readers has involved history, actually. And I feel it's been useful, helping them imbibe a historical sense, i.e., to see things in context of that time, rather than with hindsight. We'd be a lot kinder to each other then. As for balance: both kinds of writing involve rigorous research. I might say writing for younger readers is somewhat challenging for one has to explain complexities or crunch too much in too little but I think younger readers come with greater acceptance and perceptiveness too. I like the opportunities I've got really; I hope I am accepted too for all that I write.\" ", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/featured/womenia/role-of-women-freedom-fighters-needs-to-be-made-more-enduring-763898"},
{"title": "On Everest trek, I contemplated about the next phase of my life", "date": "28 Sep 2022 6:29 PM GMT ", "description": "\"Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far they can go,\" T.S. Eliot wrote about the value of grit and determination. For travel writer, nature lover and marketing executive Saachi Dhillon, the adventure bug bit her on her very first international trip to New Zealand 14 years ago and left her yearning for more - including a trek to the Everest Base Camp to \"push myself and see how far I can go\".\n\"The adventure bug bit me on my very first international trip to New Zealand. I tried many exciting activities such as kayaking, zorbing (rolling downhill inside an orb), and a Shotover Jet ride (through a canyon at over 85 kmph). I think it began from there. I have been lucky to have travelled extensively through 24 countries; having witnessed diverse cultures, met some of the warmest people, and seen incredible sights. From monastery hopping in Bhutan, ATV riding in Siem Reap, wine-tasting in Provence, to ghost tours in Edinburgh. I owe a lot to travel and adventure. It has contributed significantly to who I am today,\" Dhillon told in an interview for her book, \"Dreaming of Everest\". \n\"I was looking for a challenge. To push myself and see how far I can go. That's when I signed up for the Everest Base Camp trek,\" she added. \n(The Base Camp of the 8,849 metre Everest, the world's highest mountain, is at 5,360 metres.) \nShe trained hard for it for six months, \"come rain, (smog) or shine. From running, strength, and conditioning to cardio, I diligently prepared my body and mind for the upcoming adventure. Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is a real threat at those high altitudes and that is what made me anxious in the months leading up to the trek. I would run up nineteen stories of my building with a backpack to improve my lung capacity and minimise the chances of AMS. Needless to say, I was fitter than ever before in my life,\" Dhillon explained. \nDescribing her book as \"an inspiring, personal narrative about pushing your boundaries, following your dreams, and in the process, discovering a new part of you\", she said the aim of writing it \"is to inspire even the hoi polloi to realise impossible dreams and prove that limitations exist only in the mind\". \n\"It was my dream to trek to Mount Everest. I still remember the first time I got a glimpse of the world's highest mountain in Namche Bazar. We climbed up to the Everest viewpoint located high above the town on a clear, crisp morning. She stood tall amongst the other eight-thousanders. My heart brimmed with joy,\" Dhillon declared. \nThe Everest Base Camp trek was also the first time that she was cut off from the rest of the world for such a long duration. \n\"There was no phone signal beyond day three. This gave me an opportunity to contemplate, reflect and think about the next phase of my life. Nature is a great teacher. Its calming, healing, and revitalising forces are unparalleled as I realised on the expedition,\" Dhillon said. \nClose to base camp, her oxygen levels plummeted to almost 50 per cent - but that didn't deter her from pressing on. \n\"Every step forward was hard. My body was not cooperating with my mind. My guide egged me on. The pain from my back pierced into my chest. It was probably the most discomfort I have experienced in my life. But, I kept going and completed the trek. If you convince yourself that you can do something, you eventually will, as I learnt on this great adventure,\" she said. \nAnother first on the trek was not having a bath for a week given the harsh conditions. \"The germophobe in me survived!\" \nSomewhere along the way, she managed to write a poem encapsulating how she felt: \"The weight that we carry/Invisible at that./Yaks cross over, their bells tinkling;/We walk quietly, one breath at a time. Weary travellers young & old;/taking a sip of life./The journey stark and beautiful;/With friends like family,/Our feet carry us as far as we choose,/What will your choice be?\" \nThe icing on the cake, as it were, is the Foreword that renowned mountaineer, speaker and Sir Edmund Hillary's son Peter Hillary has written for the book. \n\"We need more adventurers like Saachi Dhillion. People prepared to head out into what is for them the unknown. We all have 'unknowns' that can only be known by being bold and taking the first step, and then another and another. The process is exhilarating and with every step, we learn about the challenge and what will be required of us, but also, we learn about ourselves. Perhaps that is the most important learning of all. As Saachi says herself the journey highlights just how much 'baggage all of us carry in our lives'. And how in the end you can 'emerge lighter as your inhibitions float away into the thin air'. \"I think that realisation is a delightful and fine reason to trudge up the trails of the Himalayas to Everest Basecamp at 5360 metres altitude and the foot of the world's highest mountain. As my father said, 'It is not the mountain we conquer, but ourselves'. And that is the story of this book,\" Hillary writes. \nThe uphill climb had taken nine days and the return to Lukla, from where the trek originated, took three days. \n\"Having reached Lukla after traversing 130 km, we finally celebrated with some song and dance and lots of local rum. Continuing with the tradition of many firsts on this trek, I lost my voice after too much singing and rum. It did return the next day - revitalised, ready to take on the next phase of life,\" Dhillon writes. \nWhat's the next big adventure she's going to be embarking on? \"I plan to climb a 6,000-metre mountain next and am currently preparing for it,\" Dhillon said.

{"title": "Aruna Chakravarti's 'The Mendicant Prince' dramatically recreates a century-old mystery", "date": "25 Sep 2022 6:21 PM GMT ", "description": "A hundred and fifty years ago, Bhawal was a prosperous zamindari in the eastern part of undivided Bengal, in size and income next only to that owned by the Khwajas, the nawab family of Dacca.\nIn the winter of 1909, Ramendranarayan Roy, the ailing second prince of the Bhawal, travelled to Darjeeling with his wife Bibhavati, brother-in-law Satyendranath and a retinue of officials and servants, after his physicians advised a change of air. Three weeks later, a telegram from Satyendranath arrived at the Bhawal estate with news of the prince's demise and his cremation. \nBut that was not the end of the matter, because 12 years later, the story took a bewildering turn with the arrival in Bhawal of a mendicant who claimed to be the long-lost prince and the heir to the estate. \nAfter a protracted legal battle that went right up to the Privy Council, in what was known as the Bhawal sannyasi case, the mendicant was accepted as who he claimed to be - the heir to the estate. \nThis is a saga that has captivated renowned academic and Sahitya Akademy Award winner Aruna Chakravarti - she was the long-serving Principal of Delhi University's Janki Devi College, where she taught for 40 years. After meticulous research, she has dramatically brought alive this intriguing tale of dual identity and the inexplicable quirks of fate in \"The Mendicant Prince\" (Picador India), her 16th novel. \n\"I first heard of the Bhawal case at the age of ten. But even at that tender age it left a powerful impact on me. I was captivated by the intricacies and unanswered questions. But I never thought of writing about it till recently, when some friends distantly related to the Bhawal family, urged me to,\" Chakravarti told in an interview. \nGiven that she had written two fictional family histories, on her own family in \"The Inheritors\" and the Tagore family in \"Jorasanko\" and \"Daughters of Jorasanko\", she was \"lured by the idea but resisted it at first.\" \n\"It was too big and complex a project. The facts of the case were out in the public domain. What more could I add to them? A fictional representation would not be easy. A meticulous adherence to the facts together with the dates was imperative. A creative reconstruction of the case as well as the lives and times of the concerned persons called for tremendous imaginative power and an equal amount of discipline and concentration. I thought I wouldn't be able to pull it off,\" Chakravarti explained. \nTwo films, \"Sannyasi Raja\" and \"Ek Je Chhilo Raja\", offered a few glimmerings but these, however, were negligible. \n\"What came in truly useful was the first-hand research I had done for my earlier work such as my translations of the Bengali masters and my own creative work. For example, my translations of Sunil Gangopadhyay's 'Sei Samay' (Those Days) and 'Prothom Alo' (First Light) helped me obtain brilliant insights into the lives of rajas and zamindars of the era, their decadence and dwindling influence under the rising power of the British. \n\"The Mendicant Prince\", however, showcases a somewhat later period when British imperialism was slowly eroding under the pressure of an awakening nationalism. \nChakravarti also had the privilege of conversing with some relatives and family friends of the Bhawals. \n\"They were not structured interviews. Some family gossip and reminiscences were shared from time to time. The identity question and quirks of fate were embedded in the history of the case. All I did was attempt to bring them to life by weaving, in between the facts, personal revelations of the characters, especially the women of the family. That part is purely fictional,\" Chakravarti said. Playing the Devil's Advocate, is there a parallel between Ramendranarayan Roy and Gumnami Baba? \n\"The only parallel that can be drawn between the two is that both had been ascetics. Ramendranarayan claimed that after the incident of his supposed death, he had lost his memory and joined a band of mendicants. After twelve years of living as a sadhu he had remembered that he came from a place called Dhaka. Advised by his guru to go to Dhaka he had done so and, once there, the recovery of his memory was swift.\" \n\"He realised that he was the second prince of the realm and demanded his rights as heir by moving the courts. His plea that he had suffered from amnesia in the intervening period had been put to the test by several doctors during the trial and was upheld by them and subsequently by the judge.\" \n\"Gumnami Baba's case was different. He didn't claim loss of memory or identity. He said he had no name and no fixed place of residence. Thus, his true identity remains unconfirmed to this day. The consequence of his rigid commitment to remain incognito was that very few people had actually seen him in person. Which is why he was considered by some to be Subhas Chandra Bose,\" Chakravarti elaborated. \n\"Looking back, I think one complimented the other. Administrative work was fulfilling at one level. Dry and uninspiring at another. I felt I was doing some good to society by improving the lives and minds of my students through practical measures like raising funds for extracurricular activities, inviting good speakers to inspire them, procuring more books for the library, and bettering academic standards by choosing the best teachers. The job also provided the bread and butter. But I needed something more. I needed creative satisfaction. And that came from my writing.\" \n\"I worked at my office desk all day looking forward to the evening when I could go back home and write. I wrote till late into the night and got up the next morning refreshed and ready to take on my administrative responsibilities. Balancing the two worked well for me,\" Chakravarti explained. \nHer next book, \"Through a Looking Glass: Stories\", published by Om International, has just come out. It is a collection of nine stories, each with an enigmatic woman at the centre. \"The volume holds up a mirror to middle class Indian society by exploring the hidden, secret spaces of women's lives; the inner recesses of their minds, and their perception of loss and suffering. There are studies of strength and weakness, triumph and defeat, unfulfilled desires, illicit liaisons, psychological traumas and family secrets - in one explosive mix,\" Chakravarti concluded.

{"title": "Radhika Bangia: Her content speaks", "date": "23 Sep 2022 8:03 PM GMT ", "description": "Radhika Bangia, a well-known Indian Digital Content Creator and actor living in the United States with a community of over 2.4 million followers across her social media platforms.\nCurrently known for her content around Korean and Y2K Fashion, Radhika has also appeared in movies like \"Welcome Back\", \"Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya\", \"Lets Play\" ,\"Irada\", \"Gehraiyaan\", and \"High Jack\". She has managed to have an audience that eagerly waits for her next quirky video. Her videos are not only loved in India but transcend nationalities and borders. Apart from her girl next door charm, something that helps her achieve this is her ability to make international stars feel at home. The influencer has recently caught the attention of many as she continues to consistently be a hit with international celebrities. \nRadhika also seems to have a knack at making people groove on Bollywood beats with her video featuring Argentinian footballer Roberto Pereyra, both working their 'thumkas' on Shah \nRukh's song. She also had a video with Viner King Bach teaching him the secret to win an Indian girl's heart, not King Bach but King Khan style! \nIn an exclusive conversation with 'The Hans India', Radhika shares about her journey. Let's have a look into it. \nI started my journey as an actor, where I used to do gigs for various things. I used to audition a lot, but it was never a stable thing. There were months when I was completely booked and others when I simply waited for a call back. As a stress buster, I used to make videos for Instagram, which actually made me happy and they quickly went viral. When I got my first brand deal, at first, I thought it was a scam. My first payment from this deal made me realise that I could make a career out of this. \nSo, I'm concentrating on my content creation now but I do take up acting gigs that excite me every now and then- be it movies or ads. \nI'm super grateful to Instagram (Meta) to have given me this opportunity to represent India and the creator community on a global level. It was so fun because I made so many friends, learned so much, and it was truly a life-changing experience. Meeting fellow content creators, hosting panel discussions, and exploring the creator ecosystem on a much larger level is what I'll cherish for a lifetime. \nIt's very significant and impactful for upcoming creators because this is what motivates them to work for something bigger and also makes them believe that they are working in the right direction. This is the event where you meet artists from all over the world and learn about their experiences and journeys. Events like these gives a creator opportunities for networking and also explore their creative side. It just keeps getting bigger and better from there, and you will be pumped up with energy like never before. \nOMG! This was one of the highlights of this year, and still feels like a dream come true! It's directed by one of the biggest production houses in LA, and it's an honour to be a part of. The team was so good, everyone had such a fun time together, and it didn't feel like work at all. Since I'm a huge K-drama fan, it was an experience in itself to have shared the screen with some of the top Korean influencers. \nI have tons of things coming up, such as a K-Drama Podcast and lots of acting gigs.

Accepting the evolving system whilst taking pride in her culture, has brought her label into the spotlight. \nAs she completes 10 years in the fashion industry, the designer talks about her journey, the need for affordable luxury, and her upcoming AW'22 collection. \n\"A decade of Label Ridhi Mehra - this is a huge feat, and emotions are intense. A wave of joy, pride and so many other exhilarating sentiments are washing over me as I internalize this beautiful milestone in my brand's journey. Having been able to contribute to the narrative of Indian Wear for a decade with a creative vision that I have perceived over the years is a genuinely gratifying experience. The label was incepted with the idea of not just introducing affordable luxury into the Indian fashion scene but making it stick among the masses. After 10 years, it is safe to say that I, with my incredible team, pride ourselves on having achieved our goal this far. Ten years of design have been deeply fulfilling. With its equal share of challenges and roadblocks, this design journey has been one filled with immense learning, and I wouldn't have it any other way,\" she said. \nRidhi added, \"We began with our first collection in the year 2012 and only moved forth thereon. Keeping creativity, innovation, and perseverance at the core, the growth process has been satisfyingly exponential and expansive in every aspect. We now launch 7-8 collections in a year, catering to a myriad of seasons, reasons, and moods.\" \n\"From its initial days of traditional business to the modern-day digital realm, Label Ridhi Mehra has wrapped in its weaves a splendid treasure of craftsmanship, traditions, inspirations, celebrations, and beyond. I take pleasure in the fact that we are now ten years old; alive, thriving, and advancing towards a glorious future. I am genuinely grateful and optimistic, to witness many more such decades realized as milestones in this journey.\" \nThis subject has been one of the most crucial ones we've had to address, especially with the pandemic posing as an immense threat. Sustaining artisans under one roof in a challenging industry and environment has been a priority for the brand. It's the collaborative effort and teamwork that have enabled us to unanimously focus on innovating and sail through hardships. \nOur designs are thoughtfully crafted with the intention that they not just add but complement the wearer. Our silhouettes celebrate individuality. Every piece we make emotes, and encourages one to flaunt their best beautiful self, unabashedly. \nAffordable luxury is the holy grail for shoppers seeking finesse at the finest price. It is a segment in the ever-evolving fashion market that has opened vistas for consumers and creators alike to focus solely on quality without burning a hole in their pockets. \nThe consumer is intelligent, conscious, and sensible today which is why a concept like Affordable Luxury is relevant. Investing in affordable luxury is the same as investing in luxury but with the benefit of reasonable pricing, impressive quality, and long-lasting durable products which in turn helps towards being sustainable. \nFrom establishing the label to staying relevant and, most recently, Covid, challenges have been a part of the whole growing experience as a brand. My advice to aspiring young designers is: Have a clear vision, follow your intuition, and put in your best. Stay consistent and committed to your art. Believing may sound cliche but it's a cliche for a reason. It works. So, believe, commit and conquer. \nSimple lines, intricate embroidery, and elegant silhouettes are the definitions of the Ridhi Mehra Signature collections. A balanced union of tradition with the essence of today is what we prioritize when it comes to design. This design ideology has placed us at the forefront of contemporary fashion for new-age women.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/featured/womenia/our-designs-encourage-one-to-flaunt-ones-best-beautiful-self-ridhi-mehra-762901"},

She talks how demanding television soaps are, the kind of response she is getting from the audience, and how different she is from the negative character she plays. Shooting for a daily soap, Pratiksha said, can be quite challenging. Long hours at work leave an actor with hardly any time for personal chores.\n\"You don't get time to focus on your personal life. Recently, I shot for a heavy-duty track because of which I didn't get time for my workout or even to call my parents. When you work for a daily soap, you don't get time to groom yourself, you don't get holidays and you end up shooting for more than 12 hours every day. But you also get a lot in return, especially recognition. So, it is indeed difficult and one must learn to balance work with one's personal life,\" Pratiksha pointed out. \nDelving into her character, she shared the audience response: \"I get both good and negative comments. People write that I am extremely bad, as I have come between the lead couple (Chahat Pandey and Avinash Mishra) and torture their children. I want to tell them that I am nothing like Kaajal. I dote on kids.\" \nShe added: \"I am glad that people take the character so seriously and appreciate my acting. But I still have a long way to go. I am proud that people know me from my character and wonder whether I am like the character in real life. I am grateful for the opportunity,\" she adds. \nSo, is she anything like her character? Pratiksha replies: \"Everyone has a dark side. I am not jealous like Kaajal. My father always taught me not to compete with others and hence, I don't feel the emotion of jealousy ever. Kaajal can go to any extent to achieve what she has set out for. While I can never be mean, I relate to her junoon (craziness) of accomplishing her goals.\"", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/featured/womenia/12-hour-shifts-leave-actors-with-no-personal-life-pratiksha-rai-763204"},
{"title": "The Punishment for 'No To Sex' was death for Ankita Bhandari", "date": "3 Oct 2022 1:24 AM GMT ", "description": "19-year-old Ankita Bhandari's murder is another example of entitlement, anger unchecked and the hatred some men have towards women. The rage of punishing a \"NO\" heard from a woman, is to be delivered by raping her and sometimes mutilating her. This time again, anger stopped at murder.\nFinish her till the temper is not addressed is the reasoning that these psychopaths have. They cannot understand a denial from a woman, who they think is the subjugated gender. She dare not ever bring on the wrath of a man. \nThe message given out is clear. If you dare defy, be ready to face the consequences. \nThis also isn't the first time a girl has been killed for refusing to have sex. This happens regularly, in the innumerable open and shut cases, lying for years, waiting for justice. A total of 4,71, 684 original cases and 21,088 appeals have been pending according to the data submitted by the National Legal Services Authority before the Supreme Court. \nThe BJP expelled leader Vinod Araya's son Pulkit is accused of lusting after her. He wanted to pay her for sex. According to men like these, there is an underlying belief that the girl comes from lower strata, therefore she is not allowed a choice in this matter. So obviously, she cannot deny him, his wish for pleasure. How dare she, Is the trigger. \nThis entitlement mindset, is that she has been offered cash for sex. This is kindness in the eyes of such misogynistic men. The idea is that she must consider herself lucky and fortunate that he desires her and isn't raping her instead. The boss in turn asked her to comply with the minister's son. When the 19-year-old disagreed, the (male) boss was enraged at her audacity. The unchecked temper of the boss made him violent. The reports are that he allegedly murdered her for the audacity to say \"NO\". \nThere is outrage in Uttarakhand where this crime took place, while the first six months of this year, more than 1,100 rape cases have been registered in Delhi. The Delhi Police says that the rise in cases is because of the active registration and the introduction of women-friendly helplines and booths. \n Yogita Bhayana, anti-rape activitist who runs Pari, an organisation that aids rape victims said that , \"this case has been highlighted by the media there are so many cases which are unheard and that happens because some men overabuse their power in a patriarchal society\". \nThis game played out of the undivided power and the entitlement that men think they deserve, must be seriously addressed as a part of the school syllabus and everyday work ethics. It must be understood that a no means a no. \nWomen across India have expressed their anger at the news of a 19-year-old girl's life snuffed, only for her refusal to comply. Overall in the captial city, crimes against women increased by 41 per cent in 2021 and the crimes against children increased by 32 per cent as per National commission for women \nThis distorted reality of inequality that is played out on a regular basis in an environment where women even today are not safe, is not an easy pill to swallow. The government has slogans like \"Beti Bachao\" but evidently it falls on the deaf ears of misogyny. \nThe murder of the 19-year-old, also makes us ponder on the inability of a man, who has been conditioned and allowed to view anger and entitlement as signs of his manhood. \nAnger starts with the amygdala stimulating the hypothalamus, much like the emotion of fear involved in processing the response. So what is being heard and forming convictions about it, added with the dysfunction in the temporal lobes can lead to anger and violence, which was the case in the death of 19-year-old Ankita Bhandari. \nAnger isn't a wrong emotion. It is the basic tenet of a thinking human being when they feel wronged. Anger expressed towards a cause, towards wrongdoing in society is the kind of anger that must be encouraged via writing, art or slogans. Rape is not uncontrollable anger, this is a crime and the person committing it, is a criminal. \nMen who yield power often have a fragile ego, which remains a topic less discussed. In this case, it was her denial to please his important customer, that made him resort to allegedly drowning and killing her. \nQuoting Kaveri,(name changed) a software engineer working with a large MNC in Bangalore, said \"my husband took revenge on me by raping my maid, who ran away to her village after the incident. I feel helpless, as he wants me to quit my work and stay at home. My refusal to do so broke our marriage and in turn the support system that I had in my househelp, who was always there for me. I have filed for divorce and it isn't easy to get this done amicably, as he thinks that our house help was always teasing him with her clothing\".", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/featured/womenia/the-punishment-for-no-to-sex-was-death-for-ankita-bhandari-764029"},

Should I raid Ranbir's wardrobe? And just because my body is changing doesn't mean my sense of style has to, right?\" \n\"So I started making my personal style more bump-friendly. I added elastic to my favourite jeans, designed shirts that I didn't have to share with my husband, and wore flowy dresses so as to not invite any unwanted belly-touching.

A lifetime with an art form that has changed the way she observes, interacts, and engages with people, and the world around her. But Bharatanatyam dancer Malavika Sarukkai stresses that as an artist, she continues to be on a journey of discovery. \"I think living a life with dance has made me more responsive, and reflective. Dance has changed me intrinsically,\" this Padma Shri and Sangeet Natak Akademi recipient tells.\nAdding that things are not the same for youngsters just entering this field today as compared to her time, she feels the world as we know it presently is different from what she grew up in. \"I think when I started learning dance, it allowed me to have a 'childhood', a certain innocence in approach where dance could become a sanctuary. These days, the younger generation is under more pressure. There is immense competition to 'achieve'. I feel they have less time to pause... to just be with dance.\" \nSarukkai has always insisted dance should be considered a language and not looked at it as a repertoire. Bharata Natyam is a style that she learned from extraordinary gurus who inculcated in her the foundations of this form. However, continued training for over two decades and as she internalized the form, it no longer remained a style but become a language of dance. \"This was a momentous step for me as with this discovery I crossed a critical threshold in my understanding of dance. With this clarity, I took ownership of the dance in my being, and with this, the world of creative explorations opened up.\" \nShe feels internalization is a word that constantly reminds the serious practitioner of the performing arts that there is more to be done. The process is slow and gradually increases in intensity over the years. \"The questions one asks are - how much more can one extend oneself; how much more can one inhabit the dance; how much more can one work on mastering technique? As the saying goes 'technique disguises the dancer and reveals the dance\". That's the purpose of internalizing'.\" \nFor her, the language of Bharatanatyam is inexhaustible and inspiring. \"It keeps me filled with wonderment at the sheer possibility it offers,\" she smiles. \nTalk to her about the reaction of purists when she started creating her own pieces, and Sarukkai says the body of work she has created over the last three decades is a celebration of the classical language of dance and its immense possibilities. \"These choreographies individual and thematic evolved organically over the years and were presented with conviction and passion. This was convincing testimony for the purists and dance enthusiasts and they soon realized that my journey was path-breaking and which in turn would open up possibilities for the next generation. \" \nThe dancer, who was part of HCL Concerts' 'Anubandh - Connectedness' held recently feels that more corporates need to come forward to support the arts. \"The concerts initiative by HCL to build and sustain a resilient performing arts environment is exceptional and their patronage encourages young artists to continue striving toward excellence. All corporates must understand without financial support, artists cannot create an environment of security. Artists give vision to other perspectives of life and must be seen, heard, and acknowledged,\" she says. \nSarukkai feels that overall there has not been the necessary uptick in performances and festivals as one expected and in order to nurture a vibrant performing arts scene in society, there needs to be well-organized, curated, financially sustainable programs in place over a period of time. \"We need yearly festivals which promote quality events and become part of a calendar of events which in turn sustains the momentum of interest in the viewers. To add to this, classical dance is seen as a form of entertainment often which diminishes the purpose of dance. But...in spite of these confining elements, artists continue to create, to envision. That is the power of dance,\" she concludes.

{"title": "Nanotechnology: The art of enhancing skincare like never before!", "date": "1 Oct 2022 10:19 PM GMT ", "description": "What would you do if you wanted to learn something new or know something in depth? You're going to try to know everything, right? Even the smallest details of the subject. It is a reliable method for everything. This is how nanotechnology functions. Its minute form digs deep into the problem and eradicates it from the roots.\nNanotechnology, as the name implies, is concerned with the most minute details. It is the branch of science and engineering in which phenomena occur at nanometre scales. \nNanotechnology has been a personal favourite of cosmetics manufacturers for better UV protection, deeper skin penetration, increased colour, finish quality, and long-lasting effects. So far, products such as make-up remover, facial cleanser, anti-aging lotion, sun-screens, and other water-based cosmetic formulations have shown the best results with the technology. \n \nNanotechnology, in layman's terms, is technology at its most basic. It entails controlling whatever matter it comes into contact with at the nanometer scale. This scale also deals with dimensions ranging from 1 to 100 nanometers. To grasp the concept of a nanometer, consider that it is an extremely small unit of length - a billionth (10-9) of a metre. \nThis tiny nature produces precise results at the speed of light. It leaves no stone unturned and, when used correctly, can reach great heights. However, with larger tasks come greater responsibilities. On a nanometer scale, materials may exhibit unusual properties. And even minor changes in size can completely alter the properties. \nPeople's concern for eyecare has grown as a result of irregular working hours and never-ending internet scrolling. Among the many products on the market, those based on nanotechnology have proven to be the most suitable. The under eye gel serum formula incorporates cutting-edge nanotechnology. Ingredients are subjected to an advanced particle size reduction process, in which particles are reduced to less than 50 nanometres in size. The smaller the product, the more effective it is. \nThe products' extremely small nano-particles allow them to penetrate the skin 20 times faster. It spreads evenly and targets the affected area for better absorption. Anything touching more or less than the target area may fail to produce the desired results in sensitive skin. This is an area where nanotechnology excels. Furthermore, such products undergo extensive dermatological and ophthalmological testing before entering the market, making them the safest to rely on. \n \nBecause of its effective approach to skincare, manufacturers are using nanotechnology in a wide range of cosmetics. According to studies, the average adult uses nine cosmetic products per day. These are among the most widely used products in the world and are available in a variety of forms these days, but not all of them are effective and provide long-term results. Nanotechnology's minute size makes it ideal for any skincare routine or requirement. As a result, it is preferred for almost any product that must specifically remove the problem from its roots. Issues such as dark circles and puffy eyes necessitate the most extensive use of nanotechnology to restore the freshness of the targeted area like never before.

Malika Ghalib Shah is among them.\nDespite being a successful professional, Malika decided to develop herbal beauty products under the name \"Masha By Malika\" to nurture her passion. Her products like hair oil, lotions, soaps, creams and other types of cosmetics are not common but are made from pure natural herbs without any chemicals. \nThe 29-year-old Malika, a native of Srinagar, has completed her Masters in Law and is currently working as an assistant professor. Malika has been an LLB topper in Kashmir University, and did her LLM degree from University College London in UK through a scholarship programme. \nShe started the business in the year 2019 with a focus on \"Fitness for everyone\". Although she started manufacturing herbal beauty products from her home, after a few years of increasing demand, these products are now manufactured in a small factory with the help of female employees under Malika's supervision. About 35 cosmetic items of 5 types of oils, body lotions, soaps and other types are manufactured under the name \"Masha By Malika\" for better care of skin, hair and body. \nAll these herbal products are made from natural ingredients, free from chemicals, artificial colors and fragrances. The ingredients include saffron, lavender, sandalwood, honey, apricots, almonds, walnuts, special types of turmeric, pomegranates, olives and coconuts. All these things are put to use and made in a native way and are given the shape of oil, lotion, powder and soap etc. The latter is then packaged in bottles, cans and jars. The herbs used in these products are imported from outside the Kashmir Valley as well. Malika says that although 60 to 70 per cent of these cosmetic products are sold locally, many people outside Jammu and Kashmir also show interest in buying them, for which they regularly receive orders. While understanding the importance of these herbal items, many Kashmiris living abroad also take them for use. Malika does not compromise on quality. As a result, they receive daily orders from domestic and international countries. \nMalika has equal support from her family in turning her hobby into a business. She is not only promoting her business but also providing employment to women who are financially independent. A lot of these women belong to economically weak families. Malika is keen to expand her business into a bigger factory in the near future to manufacture more products and provide employment to more people. \nIn today's era of technology and social media, Malika realised she can use them to reach out. For her this is an important tool for marketing, thanks to which not only products can be delivered to more people but also orders can be obtained. \nJammu and Kashmir women empowerment has been strengthened after August 5, 2019 when the Central government announced its decision to bifurcate the region into two Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh after revoking Article 370 and 35A of Jammu and Kashmir's special constitutional status. Since then women have taken advantage of all the opportunities that have come their way. During the last 3 years, about 4.5 lakh women have been made financially independent through self-help groups in Jammu and Kashmir. Whereas, for the first time in 70 years, the women of Jammu and Kashmir are succeeding in making their dreams a reality thanks to various government schemes.However, with dedication, courage and courage, success can be achieved in any job. With this work ethic, Malika GhalibShah is not only emerging as a successful female entrepreneur but also becoming a beacon of hope for others.

We've compiled a list of suggestions for keeping your favourite fashion jewellery in good condition during the humid monsoon season. These tips will ensure that your jewellery is as clean as if you bought it yesterday.\nIf you want to keep your fashion jewellery sparkling, make sure to keep it dry and clean, especially during the monsoon season. Fashion jewellery is not intended to be worn on a daily basis as chemicals can cause a reaction. \nCream or perfume should be kept away from your trendy jewellery. Apply your lotion and perfume first, then finish with your jewellery. Even water can be damaging to your jewellery, so remove it before washing your hands or taking a bath. \nThe vast majority of jewellery cleaners are extremely harsh on fashion jewellery and are intended to clean silver, gold, and platinum metals. As a result, do not use them to clean your fashionable jewellery. When jewellery gets wet in the rain, the best thing to do is blow dry it and then dry it with a soft cloth. \nGive your jewellery a final wipe with an anti-tarnish soft cloth before putting it away at the end of the day. \nThis ensures that no residual moisture, oil, or dust remains. Make certain that the container in which the jewellery is stored is moisture resistant. \nExcessive exposure to air and humidity can wreak havoc on your precious jewels if you keep your costume jewellery loose in a drawer. Individual, airtight bags made of anti-tarnish paper are recommended for storing jewellery. Moisture has the ability to degrade metal alloys used in jewellery, causing them to lose their lustre. To avoid this, store your jewellery in a box with a sturdy exterior and a soft interior. \nKeep it gleaming by inserting small silica gel packets to absorb moisture and keep them sheen. Blow-dry the jewellery manually to dry even the slightest of moisture. Go for a box with separate compartments to ensure that your jewellery does not get broken or scratched because of any kind of friction. \nApart from your health, monsoon is the season when your jewellery requires special attention. It is critical that you check your sparkling pieces on a regular basis so that they always reflect a new shine and brilliance, making them perfect and ready to wear while enjoying the monsoon as it is joyful, refreshing, and provides us with a burst of vibrant energy.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/featured/womenia/taking-care-of-fashion-jewellery-in-monsoon-763768"},

It will not only tone the skin, but also remove tan over a period of time. Or, mix cucumber juice with one teaspoon of mint juice and a cup of mineral water. This will suit oily and acne prone skin. \nThe juice of one cucumber can also be mixed with half teaspoon lemon juice, one teaspoon aloe vera juice and one cup rose water. Chill the mixture in the fridge. This toner will close the pores and also moisturize the skin, without making it oily. \nYou can also mix one tablespoon of cucumber juice with one cup coconut water. It makes a most refreshing skin toner, also cooling the skin. It is also a skin whitening beauty treatment if used over a period of time and lightens skin blemishes.

Next morning cool and strain and then add one tablespoon of cucumber juice and the contents of one Vitamin E capsule. \nMix well. Put in a spray bottle and use it to spray a fine mist on the face. It helps to tone, refresh and nourish the skin. Refrigerate two cucumber slices for at least half hour, and apply them on tired eyes for combating any puffiness after a hectic, exhausting day. in peak summer season . \nRemember, that home beauty recipes should not be made in large quantities.

Experimenting with the saree to get the perfect and unique look has given rise to new quirky trends and revived the appearance of this classic Indian garment. Let's have a look at some interesting and fun saree ideas.\n \nBelt saris are popular these days. Simply put on your saree as usual and add a belt that cinches around your waist at your pallu. A Kamar bandh could be worn instead of the belt for a more traditional look. \n \nThis is another saree design that is gaining popularity due to its distinct appearance. It differs from a traditional saree in that the bottom has a dhoti-style weaving, and a legging must be worn inside instead of a petticoat. \nA lovely drapery technique that spreads out the lower half of the pleats to resemble a mermaid's tail. This saree appears to need a lot of effort, yet all it requires are a few more tucks and pleats. \n \nIn addition to its flashy appearance, a saree with a pant design is also incredibly comfortable. It is great if you want to stand out throughout the wedding season! \nIn this saree style, the pallu is worn back to front rather than front to back. This pallu pattern stands out without compromising the saree's individuality. \n \nIf you want to pull off this style effectively, you must have a killer blouse. You can experiment with your blouse as much as you want with the pre-stitched gown design. Consider embellishments such as sequins, a net, a jacket-style bodice or a peplum-style bodice. \n \nIf you want to present your best face in terms of styling, go a slightly different route. Get a trendy brooch and pin it to your pallu for a fashionable look.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/featured/womenia/try-these-quirky-ways-to-wear-a-saree-764030"},

The State government has taken up several flood control measures in Hyderabad city through the SNDP programme at a cost of around Rs 985 crore. Most of the works are already going to be completed in the coming one or two months, he said. \nThe Minister said that GHMC had paid around Rs 103 crore to the agencies till September 30. Another Rs 150 crore bills were in process of payment. That means Kishan Reddy is misleading the people by not telling the people that about Rs 253 crore worth works have been completed so far. Apart from this, another Rs 200 crore worth of work was in the final stages. \"Kishan Reddy hid the fact that the SNDP works are progressing at a fast pace of about Rs 450 crore if all the bills paid, bills in process of payment and ongoing works are added together,\" said Rao. \nThe Minister further said that there was no shortage of funds for the SNDP program undertaken by GHMC and payment of bills was also going on fast. It is known that the flood threat has been reduced due to SNDP constructions and strengthening of canals undertaken in some of the most critical areas during the rainy season. Especially Bandlaguda, Nagole, Hayatnagar, Singareni Colony, Ramantapur, Alwal, Kompally, Jedimetla, Madinaguda, Nizampet, Banjara Colony, Saraswati Nagar Mansurabad, Christian Colony in Vanasthalipuram, Kodanda Ram Nagar, P&T Colony, Tapovan Colony, Swarnandhra Colony Yapral, Habib Nagar, Icrisat Colony, Hafiz Baba Nagar, Murki Nala, etc., the flood problems faced every year have been controlled by SNDP programmes, he said. \nRama Rao said, \"Kishan Reddy himself represented Amberpet or Secunderabad Parliament constituency, which he is currently representing, he is not aware of the development works that have been done, and stating through Twitter that the above works have not been done is misleading the people.\"", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/telangana/kishan-speaks-lies-to-mislead-people-says-ktr-763893"},

The Telangana State Taxi Drivers' Joint Action Committee has drawn the attention of the officials to the modus operandi of the non-transport vehicles with white number plates using them for passenger transport. \nWith this festive season, the taxi-cab drivers are lacking passengers, as the white number plate vehicles are operating on city roads as well as to districts and neighbouring States which is illegal.

The local apps are also running white number plate vehicles in the city. It is also observed that they are plying to the other districts and States.

If a passenger is unwell, there are chances that even others could contract the disease given that they are seated in '\n' proximity. Moreover, in the context of reaching the destination on time, these vehicles are driven at breakneck speed on highways, increasing the potential risk of accidents. \nEven though over-speeding by private vehicles claimed several lives in the past few months, passengers still do not hesitate to travel by them. Whereas, the transport vehicle has safety, speed-lock and insurance,\" he pointed out. The authorities said travelling in white plate number vehicles for commercial and transport purposes is not only illegal, but also prohibited.

The activists had burnt down hutments, stating that the ugly structures and slum outlook were hurting the tourism prospects of the state. \nThese workers had gone there to build railway infrastructure from various districts of Karnataka, mainly from Bijapur, Ballari, and Bidar. Since then, over the last 43 years, issues have always been on the burner like Mahadayi river water sharing, a uniform fishing ban, and now a new issue concerning land for the construction of Kannada Bhavan. The state government of Karnataka has asked for two acres of land in the central part of Goa. \nThe government had cited the reason that Goa has a formidable Kannada-speaking population and they needed an office in Goa. But the Goan activists had urged the Chief Minister of their state, Pramod Sawant, not to heed that, citing the Mahadayi river water sharing issue. Though Sawant has not replied in the negative, the Karnataka government has stepped up the demand, saying that the Kannada Bhavan will enhance the cultural and societal exchanges between the two states.

{"title": "Prevention: The ultimate solution for non-communicable diseases", "date": "22 Sep 2022 10:53 PM GMT ", "description": " Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which are mainly preventable, are said to account for over 74 percent of fatalities globally, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). Commonly, unhealthy behaviours or environmental factors lead to NCDs. In India, NCDs were responsible for 60.1 lakh deaths, the majority of which could have been prevented.\nNCDs account for 2 out of 3 fatalities. In addition to maternal mortality, under-5 childhood mortality, malnutrition, and infectious diseases, India is now severely affected by NCDs, adding to the already crowded public health agenda. In urban areas, up to 3 out of every 4 adults have diabetes or pre-diabetes. \nHeart disease is the number one killer in the world, for men and women says Dr. Nalini Saligram, CEO and Founder, Arogya World. \"Indians are very badly hit by NCDs \u2013 including heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, cancer (including Oral Cancer, Cervical cancer) chronic lung diseases, and mental health. India is a diabetes capital and a heart disease capital. India accounts for approximately 60 per cent of the world's heart disease burden. Moreover, Indians get diabetes in their 30s some 10-20 years earlier than people in the West, at the peak of their productive years. And since India is a young country with median age 27 years, the public health impact over the next several years is truly alarming,\" she added. \nEducating individuals to be aware of NCDs plays a vital role in preventing such diseases. Children should be taught the fundamentals of healthy living before their lifestyle patterns are fully formed in order for them to be healthy as adults. Thoughtful programmes must be designed to approach and instruct adults on how to improve their lifestyle. \n\"If we go to the young \u2013 adolescents, young working adults \u2013 in thoughtful ways, with well-designed programs, we as a society can go far. Middle-school children 11-14 years old are old enough to understand the significance of what they are learning and excited to learn new things \u2013 they are like sponges at that age, absorbing new tenets and concepts and using their pester power to influence their families as well. Young adults younger than 30 are important because we must reach them before they get diabetes. That is why schools and workplaces are important platforms for diabetes prevention. We can scale our impact by working with government, with other NGOs and with companies and their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) efforts,\" she explained. \nSeveral strategies are being deployed for the prevention of NCDs in India. \"The country has stepped up and invested in NCD screening in major ways and has also taken steps towards universal health coverage with Ayushman Bharat covering catastrophic healthcare expenses incurred mostly due to NCDs, for 100 million poor families. The country is also investing in setting up health and wellness centres and in training Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers about NCDs. Furthermore, India has developed digital backbones to track and manage annual screenings, knowing that early detection and referral for treatment can save lives. But more can be done to insert prevention into these existing NCD efforts,\" she added. \nTwo major reasons for the spike in NCDs include rapid urbanisation and unhealthy lifestyle. \"India is urbanising rapidly, with more and more people moving to cities to look for jobs, and urbanization itself is one of the systemic reasons for NCDs. Modern, sedentary, convenience lifestyles and the aggressive marketing tactics of Big Food and Big Tobacco are other reasons for NCDs exploding during our lifetimes to becoming one of the biggest health and development challenges of the century. India's healthcare system is weak \u2013 as was shown quite starkly during COVID \u2013 with not enough doctors and hospitals to provide the healthcare needed. Employers also can do more to improve the physical and mental health of their employees and the communities they live in,\" commented Dr. Nalini. \nPrevention is the smart solution. \"We know that according to WHO and compelling clinical studies that 80 per cent of heart disease, 80 per cent of diabetes and 40 per cent of cancers can be prevented with 3 lifestyle changes \u2013 we must eat right, increase physical activity, and avoid tobacco. \nThis is what can help us prevent diabetes in the first place and prevent it from worsening or leading to kidney disease or stroke or blindness, and very poor quality of life. It also is important in this post-COVID era, to remind everyone that it is people with underlying diabetes who are the most likely to be hospitalised, the most likely to need ICU care and the least likely to survive COVID,\" she concluded.

This has come virtually true in the case of the BJP in the coastal city of Mangaluru. The State BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel and MLA of Mangaluru city south assembly constituency Vedavyas Kamath have snatched the idea of holding a 'tiger dance' event from the young Congress campaigner Mithun Rai for the Dasara. They have floated the idea of holding the 'Pili Parba' festival of Tiger dance in stark similarity with the 'Pili Nalike' of Mithun Rai.\nKateel and Kamath found the Pilivesha was one of the top crowd pullers and it was a big motivator for the youth. Mithun Rai says \"I had begun a Foundation in my college days with the sole intention of preserving this rare folk and performing art which is unique to the coastal cities of Mangaluru and Udupi. The Pili Nalike events were being held by the Foundation for over a decade and have become a top entertainer coupled with spirited youth participation. Over the year the event became popular and troupes from various parts of the district and the neighbouring districts participated. There were reality shows on the theme based on the events my foundation hosted\" Rai told The Hans India. \nRai did not aim at gaining political popularity with his events, but without his knowledge, he had stirred up quite a movement and the youth did follow in his footsteps. \"I have political ambitions but never used this folk and performing art for advancing my political career. It is just that my name got attached to the events and people started giving me credence for the love of culture it had generated\" \nBut suddenly out of the blue the BJP bandwagon has jumped into it and for the first time, both Kateel and Kamath duo will hold 'Pili Parba' to coincide with the Dasara festivities in the city. Rai is cool with this initiative. \"I will not get dragged into a political debate on this issue, if they are genuinely interested in preserving this art form so be it\". \nHulivesha (tiger Masqueraders) roam around the city presenting the famous `tiger dance' and some acrobatics to the accompaniment of drums. There are other types of masqueraders also but mainly characters from the animal world. They also take small change or big currency notes depending on the size of the house or shop or the look of the benefactor. There are other types of masqueraders who neither stop for showing off nor wait for money. They dress up in various historical and mythological characters like the great kings and sages and visit only those houses they intimately know and perhaps accept nothing but a thirst quencher.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/karnataka/saffron-politics-hijacks-tiger-dance-of-mangaluru-dasara-763269"},

{"title": "Half of the obstacles for BBMP election cleared", "date": "19 Sep 2022 7:34 PM GMT ", "description": " In a setback to the petitioners who had fought a legal battle against the re-structuring of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) wards, the High Court dismissed many of the petitions filed challenging the re-structuring of BBMP wards in some assembly constituencies of the city. Thus, half of the obstacles to the BBMP elections have been cleared. A single member bench headed by Justice Hemant Chandangoudar on Friday dismissed the 14 separate petitions filed by MLAs Soumya Reddy, Zameer Ahmed and others seeking cancellation of the ward restructuring notification. After hearing the arguments, it dismissed all the petitions stating that it did not see any need to interfere with the notification issued by the government for re-structuring of wards. The High Court, which heard the petitions on September 13, said ward restructuring was a complex task. Wide areas need to be divided based on many factors. A specific guideline is followed for that. It is not easy to divide all the wards equally. In such a situation it is natural that minor problems arise. Therefore, if there are minor omissions, the court cannot intervene. It is significant that it was verbally stated that intervention will be done only if serious lapses are found.\nWards have been reconstituted based on 2011 census. The Supreme Court said that not only population but also geographical area and other factors can be considered while allocating wards. Therefore, without considering the contention of the petitioner, the election should be allowed. The Supreme Court has given a deadline to hold the BBMP elections.BBMP has not been governed by elected representatives for the last two years. The Election Commission has the constitutional responsibility to conduct elections in a timely manner. The commission requested that the court should consider these factors. \n \nThe single-member bench of the High Court, which has already completed the hearing of the petitions submitted regarding ward reservation, will give the final verdict on September 21. The State Election Commission is making all preparations to conduct the BBMP elections. The voter list revision work is almost completed and the final voter list will be released on September 22. After that, BBMP will announce the date for the election. By then all the petitions in the court have to be settled. At present, if the applicants file an appeal challenging the dismissal of the applications related to ward redistribution, the announcement of the election date will go ahead again.", "link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/karnataka/half-of-the-obstacles-for-bbmp-election-cleared-762375"},
